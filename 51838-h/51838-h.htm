  <h2 class='c004'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>I launch this little volume upon the great ocean
of books, craving the indulgence of the kind reader
for its shortcomings and imperfections, with the
hope that it will not be viewed with a critic's eye,
and that its imperfections may be charitably passed
by. I have endeavored to relate my experiences in
the great war of 1861-5 just as events occurred, as
if I were detailing them to family or friends in
private, or, as I have sometimes done in the past, at
gatherings of veterans and friends during the past
years.</p>

<p class='c000'>The old huntsman delights to tell of his tracking
game in the snow, the chase through the woods and
fields of the fox, deer and bear; the old sailor spins
his yarns of the adventures and perils of the deep;
the old fisherman will sometimes tell a big fish tale,
and the old soldier is wont to join in with the rest
and tell of his life in camp and field. This last I
have endeavored to do in the following pages after
the lapse of many years. I might have spun out
the story much longer, but believing that brevity is
often the soul of writing, as well as of wit, I have
endeavored to "be brief and to the point."</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>When I first undertook to write my war experiences,
I had no thought of ever publishing what I
wrote. It was only intended as a family paper,
written at the solicitation of my children.</p>

<p class='c000'>If I had undertaken to write a history of
Kemper's Brigade, or the Eleventh Regiment, or
even of the Clifton Grays (Company C), the story
would have been far less personal than are these
"Personal Reminiscences," and doubtless more
interesting to others, but of less interest to those for
whom the sketches were originally designed.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is my apology for using the personal pronoun
so often, and referring so frequently to those
who were nearest and dearest to me, all of whom—wife,
father, mother, and brothers—have passed
away, and I am left al—— no, not alone; I have
friends and old comrades still living whom I esteem
highly and who I am sure esteem me, and children
and grandchildren whom I love and who I know
love me.</p>

<p class='c000'>And it was but natural that I should desire to
transmit to these last, recollections of those nearest
and dearest to me, and of the comrades in arms with
whom I was most intimately and closely connected
during those years of blood and strife.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>If I had undertaken to give in detail all the brave
deeds performed by the men of Company C, and
those who made up the Eleventh Regiment and
Kemper's Brigade, this book would have been much
larger than it is.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Yankees had a custom of promoting men
from the ranks for brave conduct on the field of battle.
If this custom had prevailed in the Confederate
army, as I have often remarked, there would have
been more officers than privates in that army; for
no army ever had so many men so deserving and
so capable of being officers. Having, at the solicitation
of friends, determined to publish my <span class='sc'>Reminiscences</span>,
I now have only to say as to the following
pages. "What I have written I have written,"
and will let it go at that; trusting that old comrades
who may read this book will find therein something
to remind them that they were "there or thereabout,"
and that they and their sons and daughters
may find something to interest, if not something
entertaining, and perchance instructive to the young.</p>

<p class='c000'>To those who may be disposed to criticize the
accuracy of dates and incidents, and doubtless there
are inaccuracies and errors, too, I beg them to
remember that nearly fifty years have passed over
all our "memory boxes" since these war scenes were
enacted, and that the events herein related are from
my viewpoint and place on the stage of action, and
that they saw and heard many things I did not see
nor hear, and vice versa.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Any one who has heard witnesses testify in court
as to a personal difficulty between two men, if only
a common assault and battery case, or a more
serious encounter with knives and pistols, know that
no two will tell exactly the same story; so it is with
war stories. We all did not see and hear and feel
alike at the same time and place. What impressed
one and fixed an event or date indelibly on the mind,
did not impress another. And now "I don't remember,"
"I forget," "I was there, but don't recollect,"
are common expressions heard from old soldiers
when they meet and talk over the old, old times.</p>

<p class='c000'>To all comrades of Company C and all the other
companies of the Eleventh Virginia and of
Kemper's Brigade and Pickett's Division, Longstreet's
Corps, and the army of Northern Virginia,
to whom these greetings may come, I extend the
right hand of comradeship most heartily. We
marched and camped and bivouacked and fought
together. We suffered and sacrificed all save honor,
and thousands of our comrades died for a cause
which we knew and still know was just and right
and holy.</p>

<p class='c000'>And know ye that we will not be forgotten as
long as truth and chivalry shall live upon the earth,
and that generations yet unborn will be proud to
trace their genealogy back to the men who fought
under Lee and Jackson.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now, old comrades, good-bye, and may God
bless you all. At a reunion some years ago, I heard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>a veteran say, "God will never send an old Confederate
soldier to hell!" My prayer is that none of
them may ever go, or be sent to that bad place;
but let us not forget that, "By grace are ye saved,
through <em>faith</em> in Jesus Christ."</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>After a lapse of more than forty years, I here
record brief sketches of my experiences as a Confederate
soldier, beginning about the 1st of May,
1861, and ending the 21st day of May, 1865, and
some things since. Many of the occurrences herein
related remain indelibly fixed on my memory through
all these years and can never be effaced.</p>

<p class='c000'>The scenes and events of the battles are burned
into the faculty of recollection so deep that they
remain more firmly fixed than any other events in
my experience. Amidst the rush and roar and crash
of battle, every fibre of the brain is intensified and
highly wrought, and receives the scenes and events
of the hour with the accuracy and permanency of
the camera.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to many of the dates, marches and camps, my
memory has been refreshed by memoranda and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>data collected during the years, since the close of
that memorable struggle, and by the perusal of wartime
letters, and some assistance from old comrades.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have headed these sketches "Personal Reminiscences,"
which I have designed to be a simple
narrative of what I saw, heard and felt, without
any desire to recount deeds of my own; but rather,
at the solicitation of my children and others, that
they may know something of my comrades and that
I may leave to those who come after me some
record of the part, inconspicuous as it was, which I
took in that fierce and bloody conflict, my reasons,
therefor, and my convictions and actions since.
These things alone have prompted me to undertake
this task.</p>

<p class='c000'>I find already that the personal pronoun will
appear in the narrative much oftener than I would
wish. This seems unavoidable, according to the
plan and scope designed.</p>

<p class='c000'>I read sometime ago Gen. Fitzhugh Lee's life of
Gen. Robt. E. Lee. When the book was finished, I
remarked that I had a higher opinion of Fitz Lee
than ever before, for the reason that his modesty
caused him to leave himself out of the book, only
a few times mentioning Fitz Lee's Brigade or
Division incidentally, showing him to be a great
man. I would like to do likewise, but this will be
impossible.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>ORGANIZATION AND ROLL OF COMPANY</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In the year 1860, at Pigeon Run—now Gladys,
Campbell County, Va.,—near where I was born and
reared, the young men of the neighborhood, catching
the military spirit that swept over the State and
South immediately after the John Brown raid at
Harper's Ferry the year before, organized a
volunteer infantry company, "The Clifton Grays,"
named after a small stream near by, the name being
suggested by my father, the late Richard Morgan.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the organization of the company, Adam
Clement was elected captain; Jos. A. Hobson, first
lieutenant; H. H. Withers, second lieutenant; Jas.
A. Connelly, third lieutenant, and R. M. Cock,
fourth lieutenant. When mustered into service only
three lieutenants were allowed. I was elected
orderly sergeant, which position I preferred at that
time.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following is as complete a roll of the company
as I have been able to make up from memory,
and by the aid of old comrades from the beginning

<p class='c000'>No doubt several names have been omitted, and
others were killed or died from wounds and disease
not now remembered. It has been impossible to
give the number and names of all the killed and
wounded in the battles in which the company was
engaged. From three to five wounded to one killed
is about the average, I think.</p>

<p class='c000'>One man on this roll has "deserter" written after
his name. He was a good soldier while with the
company. Unfortunately he was a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nullius filus</span></i>; I
suppose he thought he had nothing to fight for.
We heard later he went to Ohio, where he drove a
stage during the war. I have never heard of him
since.</p>

<p class='c000'>I wish I could mention by name each one of these
men, what they did, and how faithfully they served
their country; but time and space and lack of memory
as to many interesting incidents will not permit
this. I can only say that, with very few exceptions,
they were good and faithful soldiers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The uniform of the company was steel-gray, with
cap of same color.</p>

  <h2 id='CHAPTER_II' class='c004'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br /> <span class='sc'>Enter the Service—Trouble about Arms—Cause<br /> of Secession</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The company was drilled from time to time, but
was not armed until it entered the service about the
1st of May, 1861, at Lynchburg, Va., enlisting for
one year. It was mustered into service by (then)
Col. Jubal A. Early, as one of the ten companies
of the Twenty-eighth Regiment of Virginia
Infantry, Col. Robt. T. Preston, commanding. At
that time there were about eighty-five men in the
company, made up of the young men from several
miles around Pigeon Run. I had one brother, Geo.
W., called "Coon"; a brother-in-law, Robt. M.
Cocke, and many kinsmen and connections in the
company; the young Joneses, the Hobsons, the
Baileys, and others were relations of myself or wife.
We were all friends and neighbors, and many were
former schoolmates. Most of them young unmarried
men, many in their teens. I had been
married not quite five months when the war came
on.</p>

<p class='c000'>None of the officers or men had any military
education, but little training in drilling and none in
camp life, and were all, officers and men, quite green
and inexperienced in military affairs generally. But
we all knew how to handle guns and how to shoot
straight.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>These young men made as brave and faithful
soldiers as any in the army; always ready to do
their duty, to go wherever ordered; standing firm
in action. But I think none of them liked to fight
just for the fun of it; I did not for one, I well know.
It was of this class of men that the army of
Northern Virginia was made up.</p>

<p class='c000'>That army was composed of the very pick and
flower of the Southern youth, and made a name and
fame that will live always.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the beginning of the war, at Manassas, Gen.
G. T. Beauregard issued a general order, in which
he said that strict military rules of discipline would
not be enforced, that the general commanding would
depend upon the good breeding of the men, rather
than harsh military discipline, to insure good order
and efficiency in the army. This kind of discipline
prevailed all through the war. General Grant soon
after he met Lee in the Wilderness said in a dispatch
to Washington that the Rebel army was very hard
to drive, so well was it disciplined. It was not
discipline that made this army so effective, but
rather the courageous and patriotic spirit of the men
who carried the guns.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>TROUBLE ABOUT ARMS</h3>

<p class='c008'>As before said, the company had not been armed
up to the time of enlistment. The company was
organized as a rifle company; we expected to be
armed with the "Mississippi Rifle."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Soon after we got to Lynchburg it was learned
that rifles could not be procured, the only arms
available being old flint-lock muskets changed to
percussion. All guns in those days were muzzle-loaders;
the breech-loaders had not been invented.</p>

<p class='c000'>We were much disappointed, and many of the
men very much disgruntled, at the prospects of
going to war with those antiquated, cumbersome
and inferior arms. Other companies were in the
same predicament, and many of the men threatened
to disband and go home. The companies had not
yet been mustered into service. It was a very
critical time in the military experience of all. The
companies were formed in line and addressed by
some of their officers. Captain Clement made a
speech to his company, and I spoke briefly and earnestly
to my comrades, telling them that the State
of Virginia was doing the very best she could to
arm and equip her soldiers, that they might go forth
to meet the invaders of her sacred soil; that it was
our duty to go to the front with the best arms available,
even if armed with nothing but "rocks and
sticks," and closed by calling on every man who was
willing to go to war under the existing circumstances
to follow. I marched out through the camp;
the whole company following.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE CAUSE OF SECESSION</h3>

<p class='c008'>I had fully determined if the company disbanded
to join another immediately, as I knew it was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>duty of every son of Virginia to enlist under her
banner when called. I have never been of any
other mind since, and if it were all to do over again
I should act in the same manner. I never thought
of deserting to the enemy during the war nor since.
While I was not an original secessionist and voted
for the Union candidates for the Convention, yet
when the North determined to wage war on the
South; when Lincoln called on Virginia for her
quota of troops to coerce the seceding States, and
when Virginia seceded, it did not take me two
seconds to cast my lot with Virginia and the other
Southern States. Here I took my stand then, now
and forever, and will never give aid in any way to
those who were enemies to my State and section,
many of whom are still haters and traducers of the
Southern people, the avowed purpose at the close
of the war being to put the negro, the late slave,
over the white people of the South, to rule and
govern as brave and chivalrous a people as ever lived
on God's green earth. To make the highest type of
the Anglo-Saxon subject to the African! Ye gods!
What a crime was attempted! And for a time the
outrage was in force. This, if nothing else, justified
the South in its attempt at separation from the
North. The people of the South had gotten tired
of the sectional and domineering, hectoring spirit of
the North, especially the New England Yankees,
manifested in many ways before the war, and determined
to sever the bonds that bound them together;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>peacefully if they could, forcibly if they must.
They did not want war, but the North forced the
issue. The question of slavery in the Southern
States was not an issue at the beginning of the war,
as many believe.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the presidential election of 1860, the right of
the slaveholder to take his slaves—property recognized
by the Constitution and laws of the land—into
the territories, was an issue made by the Republican
party, but no question as to slavery where it already
existed, was involved. On the other hand, Lincoln,
in his inaugural address on the 4th of March, 1861,
expressly declared that he had no authority to interfere
with slavery in the States, and no intention of
doing so. And not until the promulgation of Lincoln's
emancipation proclamation, which went into
effect on the 1st of January, 1863, made without
shadow of right or law, and in direct violation of
his solemn declaration and oath of office, was this
issue raised, as a war measure, to strengthen the
Union cause, which was then on the wane, among
the abolitionists at home and abroad. The New
England Yankees, who first imported the negro to
America, and who had sold their slaves to the
Southern planters, because slave labor was unprofitable
at the North, and who had engaged in the
African slave trade until this was prohibited by law,
at the instigation of the South and against the
protest of New England shipping interests which
was largely engaged in the African slave trade, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>had become rabid abolitionists, now demanded
emancipation as the price of their loyalty to the
Union cause.</p>

<p class='c000'>France had all the while been friendly inclined
towards the South, and was urging England to join
her in the recognition of the Southern Confederacy
as an independent nation. England, who had years
before abolished slavery in all her provinces, and
was known to be a nation of abolitionists, was now
appealed to, and urged to stand for emancipation
in not recognizing the independence of the South.
The cotton factories of England were closed, the
Southern ports being blockaded, the operatives were
clamoring for work or food; bread riots prevailed
in the manufacturing cities, the people urging the
recognition of the South, so that the ports could be
opened and cotton, work, and food procured.</p>

<p class='c000'>Henry Ward Beecher and other abolitionists went
to England, faced and spoke to these howling mobs,
appealing to them in behalf of the Union cause and
the Southern slaves. Not so much, I opine, for the
good of the slaves as for the success of the Union
cause. They all knew if the Southern ports were
opened the South would be victorious.</p>

<p class='c000'>These are the true facts and the reasons for Lincoln's
emancipation proclamation, as I verily believe,
and well known at the time. New England was
always jealous of the South, opposed everything
that would extend the influence and power of the
Southern States: fought bitterly the acquisition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>of the Louisiana territory and also the annexation
of Texas, because it would tend to destroy the
"balance of power," as they called it; and one of
these states, Massachusetts, threatened to withdraw
from the Union, boldly claiming the right so to do.
As all know, New England was the manufacturing
section of the country—the South, the agricultural
section. New England wanted to control the policy
of the government as to the tariff, and thereby protect
their industries, and could not brook the extension
of Southern influence and power against their
protection policy. They still to this day maintain
this policy, but now we are beginning to hear the
rumblings of discontent in the West, and I am
curious to know what will be the result. I know
one thing—that the Yankees of New England will
hold on to their pet policies, "like grim death to a
dead nigger." What the great West will do, future
events only can develop. The North has held the
West in political slavery, by abusing and vilifying
the South, and by waving the "bloody shirt"; but
that old rag is about worn out. I repeat, I am
curious to know the result, and want to live to see
the end of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>We remained in Lynchburg until about the 1st of
June, 1861, doing camp duty and drilling. Several
of the company, including my brother and myself,
had negro cooks the first year, after which, few, if
any, remained, except ours, who stayed until the
last. Rations became too scarce to divide with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>cooks, so the men did their own cooking, forming
messes of from four to six and eight men to a
mess, cooking by turns when in camp. We also
had two or three company cooks detailed from the
company, who did much of the cooking when not
in permanent camp, one of whom, Isaac Walthall,
acted as company commissary, drawing the rations
from the regimental commissary and distributed
them to the messes, when in camp, or cooking them
and distributing to men when in line of battle or
near the enemy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our camp equipments, as far as cooking facilities
were concerned, were very poor, and never much
better.</p>

<p class='c000'>At first, we had only sheet-iron pans and boilers,
called camp kettles, which did very well for boiling
beef, but the sheet-iron pans were very poor for
baking bread and frying meat. No wonder the biscuits
were called "sinkers," being burned on the outside,
tough and clammy through and through. We
afterwards got ovens and skillets, "spiders," as the
Tar Heels called them, and had better bread. We
were in camp in a grove west of College Hill, which
was afterwards the fair grounds, and is now Miller
Park.</p>

  <h2 id='CHAPTER_III' class='c004'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br /> <span class='sc'>On to Manassas—The Eleventh Regiment—The<br /> First Brigade</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>About the 1st of June, 1861, the regiment was
ordered to Manassas, which name afterwards became
historic as a great battle-ground. The first
battle of Bull Run, on the 18th of July, 1861, and
the ground on which the first battle of Manassas
was fought on the 21st of July, 1861, and the
second battle of Manassas on the 30th of August,
1862, are all in close proximity, and General Jackson,
a few days before the last-named fight, by a
bold movement captured the place, which was then
Pope's dépôt of supplies, burning what his soldiers
could not eat and carry off, which no doubt was a
plenty.</p>

<p class='c000'>The place was occupied by one side or the other
during nearly the whole war, being, in the beginning,
considered a strategic point in the defence of Richmond
by the Confederates, and for the defence of
Washington and for the advance on Richmond by
the Yankees.</p>

<p class='c000'>At Lynchburg we had no equipments except the
old muskets, no belts, cartridge or cap boxes, only
some little cotton-cloth bags such as mothers make
children to gather chinquapins in, little tin shop-made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>canteens, home-made haversacks of cotton
cloth or cheap oilcloth, home-made knapsacks of
poor material and very cumbersome, the latter
packed full of clothes, hair-brushes and shoe-brushes,
needle cases, and many other little tricks
which mothers, wives, and sweethearts made for
their soldier boys. Many of these things were
superfluous and were not carried after the first year
of the war; for the next three years about all a
Confederate soldier carried was his gun, cartridge
and cap box, a blanket, an oilcloth captured from
the Yankees, and an extra shirt—very often not the
latter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many a Confederate soldier has taken off his
shirt, washed it, hung it on a bush, lying in the
shade until it was dry. He also carried a haversack
which was often empty.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was considerable excitement when it was
known we were to go to the front, to meet the
enemy; hasty preparations were made, tents were
struck, which, with the cooking utensils and all camp
equipment, were sent to the dépôt for shipment.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the appointed hour the regiment, with Colonel
Bob Preston mounted on his big nicked-tailed bay
horse, handsomely caparisoned, at its head, marched
through the city down to the Orange &amp; Alexandria
Railroad, now the Southern. The streets were lined
with people, the men cheering, the ladies waving
their handkerchiefs to the soldiers as they marched
in proud array to martial music—the fife and drum.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Boarding the train, in box cars, we rolled away
to the seat of war.</p>

<p class='c000'>The train was stopped at Culpeper Court House,
the troops detrained, and marched out into a field
northwest of the town and prepared to go into
camp; very much disappointed that we had been
stopped before reaching Manassas. I remember it
was a very windy day, and we had great difficulty
in raising the tents. Before this was fully accomplished,
orders came to strike tents at once, board
the cars and hurry on to Manassas. The rumor
was that the Yankees were advancing on Manassas
and we were to rush forward as fast as possible, to
meet and drive them back. All was now bustle and
excitement; in an incredible short time the tents
were struck, rolled up, taken to the dépôt, placed on
the cars, and the regiment was soon off again for
the front. Of course, discussion as to the probability
of soon being in a battle went on as we sped
along.</p>

<p class='c000'>Up to this time, no cartridges had been issued to
the men; some cases or boxes of ammunition were
now placed aboard each car, but were not opened.
The men were very anxious to be supplied with
cartridges, fearing the Yankees would be on us before
the boxes could be opened and the guns loaded.</p>

<p class='c000'>In due time, the train reached Manassas without
running into the enemy or the enemy running into
us. It was said a scouting party had come out from
the Yankee lines near Alexandria, and hence the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>false alarm which caused our hasty and exciting
exit from Culpeper.</p>

<p class='c000'>The regiment went into camp at Manassas station,
a short distance to the right of the railroad, where
we remained for about two weeks, drilling and doing
guard duty around the camp and at General
Beauregard's headquarters not far away. Not long
before the first battle, Captain Clement's company,
and Captain Hutter's company from Lynchburg,
were transferred to the Eleventh Virginia Regiment,
commanded by Colonel Samuel Garland, Jr.,
of Lynchburg, a V. M. I. man, and a fine officer.
In the regiment there were already three companies
from Lynchburg and one from Campbell County.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE ELEVENTH REGIMENT</h3>

<p class='c008'>The Eleventh Regiment, which was camped immediately
on the north side of the railroad, just west
of the dépôt, was now composed of ten companies,
with the following named field and staff officers
and company commanders:</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel, Sam Garland, Jr., of Lynchburg; Lieut.-Colonel,
David Funston, of Alexandria; Major, Carter
H. Harrison, of Lancaster County; Adjutant,
J. Lawrence Meem; Sergeant Major, Chas. A.
Tyree; Chaplain, Rev. J. C. Granberry; Surgeon,
Dr. G. W. Thornhill; Assistant Surgeon, Dr.
Chalmers; Quarter-Master, R. G. H. Kean; Commissary,
L. F. Lucado; Commissary Sergeant, W. L.
Akers.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Company A, Capt. Morris S. Langhorne; Company
B, Capt. Robert C. Saunders; Company C,
Capt. Adam Clement; Company D, Capt. D.
Gardner Houston; Company E, Capt. J. E. Blankenship;
Company F, Capt. Henry Foulks; Company
G, Capt. Kirk Otey; Company H, Capt. J. Risque
Hutter; Company I, Capt. —— Jamison; Company
K, Capt. Robert Yeatman.</p>

<p class='c000'>Colonel Garland was promoted to brigadier-general
in May, 1862, and was killed at Boonsboro
Mountain, Md., in September, 1862. Lieutenant-Colonel
Funston succeeded Colonel Garland in
command of the regiment, and was disabled by
wounds at Seven Pines, on the 30th of May, 1862,
and retired from the service; he was later elected
to the Confederate Congress, and I think still later
was in the service again. Major Harrison was
mortally wounded at Bull Run, July 18, 1861.
Captain Langhorne succeeded him as major and was
afterwards promoted lieutenant-colonel. He was
disabled by wounds at Seven Pines on the 30th of
May, 1862, and never returned to the army.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Clement was promoted to major just before
the Seven Pines fight, was disabled at the battle
of Sharpsburg, Md., the 17th of September, 1862,
while in command of the regiment, and never returned
to the field.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Saunders retired at the end of the first
year, and was afterwards in the commissary department
as collector of tax in kind.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Captain Houston was killed at Gettysburg on the
3d of July, 1863.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Blankenship retired at the battle of Blackburn's
Ford on the 18th of July, 1861; he secured
a position in the engineering corps, I think.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Foulks was killed at Seven Pines. I was
in a few feet of him when he was shot dead.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Yeatman resigned.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lieut. G. W. Latham succeeded Captain Langhorne
in command of Company A, and he was succeeded
by Lieut. Robt. M. Mitchell, Jr. Lieut. Thos.
B. Horton succeeded Captain Saunders of Company
B, and I succeeded Captain Clement of Company C;
Lieut. Thos. Houston succeeded his brother, D. G.
Houston, of Company D; Lieut. C. V. Winfrey
succeeded Captain Blankenship of Company E;
Lieut. Robt. W. Douthat succeeded Captain Foulks
of Company F; Lieut. J. Holmes Smith succeeded
Captain Otey of Company G; Lieut. Jas. W. Hord
succeeded Captain Hutter of Company H; Lieut.
A. I. Jones, I think, succeeded Captain Jamison of
Company I; Lieut. Andrew M. Houston, a brother
of the other Houstons already mentioned, succeeded
Captain Yeatman of Company K; Captain Otey
was promoted to major, lieutenant-colonel and
colonel. Captain Hutter was promoted to lieutenant-colonel,
and was in command of the regiment at the
battle of Five Forks on the 5th of April, 1865, when
he and nearly all of the regiment were captured.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Capt. C. V. Winfrey, of Company E, was afterwards
succeeded by Lieut. John C. Ward. Several
of these officers were V. M. I. men, as I now remember,
as follows: Garland, Harrison, Otey,
Hutter, Blankenship, Ward, D. G. Houston, and
perhaps others.</p>

<p class='c000'>Company G, the old "Home Guard," was the
crack company of the regiment. Company A, the
"Rifle Grays," also of Lynchburg, was a close
second to Company G, armed with the Mississippi
rifle, and generally acted as skirmishers, and one of
these rifles brought down the first Yankee on the
18th of July, 1861, as hereinafter related.</p>

<p class='c000'>Company D was also armed with Mississippi
rifles and was often on the skirmish line. Company
B was made up of men from the western section of
Campbell County; Company C, as before said, from
the Pigeon Run section, Mt. Zion, and Falling River
neighborhoods. Company D came from Botetourt
County—large, hardy, hale fellows they were too,
many of them with German names. Company E
was made up largely of college boys from Lynchburg
College, its first captain being one of the
professors.</p>

<p class='c000'>Company F, a sturdy lot of men, came from the
hills of Alleghany Mountains in Montgomery
County around Christiansburg.</p>

<p class='c000'>Company H was a new Lynchburg company,
recruited by its captain, then in his teens, with many
sons of Erin in its ranks.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Company I was made up of men from Culpeper
County.</p>

<p class='c000'>Company K was from the James River section of
Rockbridge County—its commander, a canal
freight-boat captain, and many of the men boatmen
on the canal when the tocsin of war was sounded.
All classes, from the college-bred and the professional
man to the country schoolboy, were represented
in the regiment.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following are the rolls of the four Lynchburg
companies of the Eleventh Regiment. I have
been unable to get the rolls of the other companies
of the regiment:</p>

<p class='c000'>The Eleventh Regiment soon won an enviable
reputation; it was well officered, well drilled and
not excelled by any regiment in the First Brigade,
which was first commanded by Longstreet, then by
A. P. Hill, then by J. L. Kemper, and later by
Wm. R. Terry. This brigade was as good as any
brigade in Pickett's Division; Pickett's Division
was not surpassed by any division in Longstreet's
corps; Longstreet's Corps was equal to any corps
in the army of Northern Virginia, and the world
never saw a better army than the army of Northern
Virginia.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>While at Manassas, many troops came on from
the South. All were organized into regiments and
brigades. The First, Third, Seventh, Eleventh and
Seventeenth Virginia Regiments composed the First
Brigade of Virginia Infantry, commanded by Brig.-Gen.
James Longstreet. In September, 1862, the
Seventeenth Regiment was put in Corse's Brigade,
and the Twenty-fourth Virginia was added to Longstreet's
old brigade.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Twenty-fourth was then commanded by Col.
W. R. Terry, Lieut.-Col. Peter Hairston, and Maj.
Richard F. Maury.</p>

<p class='c000'>The First Regiment was commanded by Col.
P. T. Moore, of Richmond, Lieut.-Col. G. W.
Palmer, I think, and Maj. John Dooly, and was
made up entirely of Richmond companies.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Third Regiment was commanded by Col.
Joseph Mayo, Jr., Lieut.-Col. Wm. H. Pryor, and
Maj. John D. Whitehead.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Seventh Regiment was commanded by Col.
J. L. Kemper, of Madison County; Lieut.-Col. W.
Tazwell Patton, and Maj. C. C. Floweree.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Seventeenth Regiment was commanded by
Col. M. D. Corse, of Alexandria; Lieut.-Col.
Morton Mayre, and Maj. Wm. Munford.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were many changes in these field officers.
Perhaps I have failed to name correctly all the

  <h2 id='CHAPTER_IV' class='c004'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br /> <span class='sc'>Battle of Blackburn's Ford—The Battle<br /> Begins—The Enemy Driven Back—Incidents<br /> of the Battle</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>There were frequent rumors while in camp at
Manassas that the Yankees were advancing. On
the 17th of July the report proved true; the
Yankees were coming sure enough this time. Longstreet's
Brigade marched down to Blackburn's Ford
on Bull Run some mile and a half or two miles
north of Manassas. The regiments, except the
Eleventh, were formed in line of battle above and
below the ford, along the south bank of the creek,
or run, as it is called, a small wooded stream with
the ground rising on the north side to quite a bluff,
heavily timbered, the road from the ford leading
up through a narrow ravine. Other brigades were
posted along Bull Run above and below Blackburn's
Ford.</p>

<p class='c000'>The men on the line of battle made temporary
breastworks along the bank of the run, with old
logs, driftwood, and fence rails, and awaited the
coming of the enemy—skirmishers having been
thrown well forward on the high ground beyond
the stream and woods.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>The Eleventh Regiment, held in reserve, was
placed behind a small bluff, a short distance south
of the stream and above the ford. This bluff was
pretty good protection except from fragments of
shells bursting overhead.</p>

<p class='c000'>The enemy did not appear until the next day in
the afternoon, when the attack was made on the
position at the ford about three o'clock. Company A
of the Eleventh Regiment was on picket, or skirmish
line, across the run, when a Yankee quartermaster
captain rode down the road, and enquired of one
of the company if he knew where General McDowell's
(the Yankee commander's) headquarters
were. The man replied, "No, I don't know where
General McDowell's headquarters are, but I can
show you to General Beauregard's very quick."
The captain seeing his mistake wheeled his horse
and dashed away.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several of the pickets fired on him, when he
tumbled from his horse dead, shot through the
body. The captain had on a pair of spurs, which
one of the men took off, and when the company
returned to the regiment after the Yankees advanced
in force, gave the spurs to Major Harrison,
who put them on and in a short time thereafter
received his death wound. Unlucky spurs these!
My recollection is, as I heard it after the battle,
that when the Yankee fell from his horse, Henry
Beckwith said, as they approached him, "If he is
shot through the belt, I killed him. I aimed at his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>belt"; and that the ball had entered the body at or
near the belt. Tom Davis, Leslie Price, and Jim
Foulks, I think, were the other men who fired.
Who really fired the fatal shot was not known.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE BATTLE BEGINS</h3>

<p class='c008'>Pretty soon after the captain was shot, the
Yankees advanced in line of battle, the skirmishers
in front engaging in a lively fight over on the hill
beyond the run, the Confederates retiring as the
main body of the enemy advanced. All knew then
that the fight was beginning and would soon be on
in earnest. After the Confederate skirmishers returned
to the south side of the run everything was
quiet—a deathlike stillness prevailed for some time,
which was intense and oppressive. All nerves were
strung to a high tension. We were on the eve of a
battle, a sure enough battle in which men would be
wounded and killed, and who would be the victims
no one knew.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps not a single man in the brigade, with the
exception of General Longstreet, had ever heard the
sound of a hostile gun before that day.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not long, however, until this silence was
broken by the big boom of a Yankee cannon away
over on the hill, and simultaneously, a long shell
came shrieking through the air, making a noise that
can not be described; it was more like the neigh
of an excited or frightened horse than anything I
can compare it to; a kind of "whicker, whicker,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>whicker" sound as it swapped ends in the air. This
shell passed over high above all heads, striking the
ground on the hill in the rear, making the dirt fly,
and tearing a hole in the ground, as some of the
boys said, "Big enough to bury a horse in."</p>

<p class='c000'>I have said that all nerves were highly strung
while waiting for the battle to begin. This shot and
shell not only broke the silence and relaxed the
nerve tension, but severely tried not a few nerves,
caused many a heart to stand still, and face to
blanch. I saw many pale faces; don't know how
I looked, but felt rather pale.</p>

<p class='c000'>This shell struck near a Confederate battery,
which immediately limbered up and went to the
rear at a gallop—why, I never knew; the supposition
was that the battery withdrew in order to draw the
Yankees on; if so, it had the desired effect, for in
a few minutes the musketry firing began down at
the ford. At first it was pop—pop—pop, then
pop, pop, pop—and then a continuous roar in which
no single shot could be distinguished; it was like a
loud, continuing peal of heavy thunder. The roar was
punctuated by frequent cannon shot and bursting
shells, which sounded louder than the musketry.
The noise was frightful, almost deafening, and such
as we never heard before, but knew full well it was
the "noise and din of battle," about which we had
heard and read, but never experienced. I must say
it was more terrific and awe-inspiring than I expected.
Many of the balls and shells passed a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>feet above us; shells and grapeshot struck among
the trees and bushes that crowned the small bluff
behind which the regiment was posted, with the
rushing, swishing, fear-creating noise heard many
times afterwards, but which I never learned to like
or admire.</p>

<p class='c000'>History records that General Washington, in his
youthful days, in writing to a friend describing a
battle with the Indians, said, "The sound of the
bullets was music to mine ear." Now, I never had
much ear for music, though I like good music, and
can distinguish between good and bad music. I
here and now record that the sound of shell, solid
shot, grapeshot, shrapnel, minie ball, or any other
kind of battle noise, was never "music to mine ear";
therefore, I conclude that any and all of these
sounds, if music at all, is very poor music.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the battle, Company G, of the Eleventh
Regiment, was deployed as skirmishers along the
run on the left flank of the Confederate line of
battle, not far from the position occupied by the
regiment, the men all lying down behind a fence that
ran along the bank of Bull Run, in plain view of
the other companies of the Eleventh Regiment; no
Yankees appeared on this part of the line. And,
I think, Company F was also deployed below Company
G near the run.</p>

<p class='c000'>The heavy firing in this battle did not last long,
not over half an hour perhaps, but it seemed a long
time.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>In the midst of the heaviest firing, one of General
Longstreet's staff officers galloped up to the
Eleventh Regiment and called for two companies
to go down to the ford. When asked how the battle
was going, he said, "They have the advantage of
us just now, but we will drive them back with these
two companies." Some of the Yankees had charged
across the creek, or run, at the ford. Colonel Garland
called out at the top of his voice, "Major
Harrison, take Company E and Company H down
to the ford." These two companies, with Major
Harrison leading them on horseback, rushed off
through the bushes in double-quick time and into the
fight they went.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE YANKEES DRIVEN BACK</h3>

<p class='c008'>The Yankees were quickly driven back. Dr.
G. W. Thornhill, surgeon of the Eleventh Regiment,
who went along to look after the wounded, captured
a Yankee who had crossed over the run and was
hiding in the bushes. Very soon, Major Harrison
was borne back from the line of battle on a stretcher,
or litter, as it was called, shot through the body, and
as before said, mortally wounded. Major Harrison
was a good officer and a splendid man, very
popular in the regiment, and his untimely death was
deeply lamented by all. It was rumored through
the brigade that Colonel Garland had been mortally
wounded. When he heard this rumor, he said, "It
was a better man." A fine tribute this, to Major
Harrison.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Soon after the two companies went into the fight,
the Twenty-fourth Virginia Regiment, led by Col.
Peter Hairston on horseback, came double-quicking
down the road leading to the ford.</p>

<p class='c000'>Company A of the Twenty-fourth was the leading
company and was commanded by Capt. C. M. Stigleman,
and Dr. B. P. Elliott was orderly sergeant.
This company was from Floyd County. I did not
know any of the officers or men; but since I came
to Floyd, have been well acquainted with nearly all
of them, and have often talked about the incidents
of this day. I have heard Dr. Elliott relate that, as
they started into the fight they passed by General
Beauregard standing by the roadside, and that the
General spoke to each company as it passed saying,
"Aim low, men."</p>

<p class='c000'>The doctor, in telling it, would laugh and say,
"These words sent a chill down my spinal column,"
and that when they emerged from the pines into
the open field, and saw the men of Company G lying
down in skirmish line, they thought these men had
been killed and laid out there in a row, and some
one exclaimed, "Good God, look at the dead men!"</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Elliott also related, as they passed by Major
Harrison, being borne to the rear on the stretcher,
the Major said, "Hurry up, men, or you will be too
late"; and that Colonel Early said to them as they
started, "Now, boys, if you don't run, the Yankees
will." And when the command was given the regiment
to load, one of the captains stepped out in
front of his company and gave the command, "Load
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>in nine times—load!" Then "old Jube" in his
piping voice at a high pitch, exclaimed, "Load in
nine times? Hell and damnation! Load in the most
expeditious manner possible."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Twenty-fourth was the leading regiment of
a brigade commanded by Col. Jubal A. Early.
About the time the front files of the regiment was
half-way across the field between the pines and the
run, Colonel Early came riding along down by
the line, his black horse in a long trot, calling out,
"Halt in front!" Colonel Hairston could not hear
him on account of the noise of the battle. Finally,
Colonel Early reined in his horse so hard that the
war steed was thrown well back on his haunches,
and called out in a loud and emphatic tone, "Tell
Colonel Hairston to halt." From the position occupied
by the Eleventh Regiment, we could see and
hear all these incidents.</p>

<p class='c000'>The word "halt" was passed rapidly along to the
front of the regiment, and just before the head of
the column (the troops were marching by the flank)
reached the bushes bordering the run, they came to
a halt, and Colonel Early went forward to find
General Longstreet and ascertain where to place his
brigade in line of battle. Just then the firing
slackened and in a few moments the musketry firing
ceased altogether. The Yankees had been driven
back, retiring out of sight over the hill; the artillery
fire was kept up for some time, however.</p>

<p class='c000'>Up to this time the Confederates had no artillery
engaged in the fight, though a few shots were fired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>at the right flank of the enemy from Mitchell's Ford,
where General Bonham of South Carolina commanded.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon after the musketry firing ceased, and while
the Yankees were still throwing shot and shell from
their guns on the hill, scaring many but hurting
few, a battery of the New Orleans Washington
Artillery came in a gallop into the open field, and
wheeling to the right into battery, about midway
between the pines and the run, unlimbered and
opened up a lively fire at the Yankee battery over
on the hill beyond the run. These batteries were
not in sight the one of the other, the woods on and
beyond the run intervening to obstruct the view, the
gunners firing at the puffs of smoke from their
opponents' guns.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was a lively and spirited artillery duel for
a while, but the plucky Louisianians proved too
much for their opponents. When the Yankee
gunners got the range on them, they moved their
guns by hand to the right or left and poured shot
and shell into the enemy thick and fast, soon knocking
their opponents out of action, disabling one or
more of their guns, and causing them to get out of
range in great haste. The Washington Artillery
won laurels in this their first fight, which they wore
proudly and deservedly through the whole war,
being conspicuous in all the great battles in which
the army of Northern Virginia engaged, and always
performing their part bravely and well.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>INCIDENTS OF THE BATTLE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In the midst of the battle General Longstreet's
big bay horse came galloping out from the bushes
along the run, riderless, and wild with the noise
and excitement of battle, dashing across the field
with head high in air, swaying from right to left,
with bridle reins and stirrups flying over his neck
and back. We thought sure our General was either
killed or badly wounded, but it turned out that
General Longstreet had thrown himself off his horse
to the ground to escape the fire of some of his own
men. The general was unhurt, and was soon again
mounted on his horse, though there was dirt on his
clothes from the fall to the ground. The smoke of
the battle, which was thick and heavy along the
run, soon cleared away, the wounded were all
carried to the field hospital in the rear, the dead
were laid away, and ere the shades of night set in,
all was peaceful and quiet along Bull Run, except
that now and then the words, "Friends on the other
side, pass it down the line," were passed from
company to company along the line, our scouts, at
intervals, crossing over the run to watch the
Yankees, lest, peradventure, they might make
another attack. But no other efforts were made to
dislodge the Confederates at Blackburn's Ford.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Yankees were very much surprised at the
stubborn resistance they met here. Their newspapers,
and other writers since, gave conflicting statements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>of the affair, some making light of it as a battle,
claiming that it was only a reconnoissance in force,
a mere skirmish. Others attributed it to the "rash
enthusiasm" of Gen. E. B. Tyler, who thought he
could easily brush aside the rebels and march on to
Manassas. General McDowell, the commander-in-chief,
who had established his headquarters at
Centreville, contemplated, it was said, turning the
Confederates' left flank when all his troops were up
and everything ready for the attack. General Tyler
had in the fight, Richardson's and Sherman's
Brigades of Infantry, and Ayres's Battery. These
were met and successfully resisted by Longstreet
with his brigade, with eight companies of one of the
regiments, the Eleventh, in reserve.</p>

<p class='c000'>The loss in this engagement was small for the
amount of shooting done. The Confederates' loss
was about twenty and the Yankees' about one
hundred. This engagement on the 18th made
General McDowell stop and ponder until the 21st
of July, when the battle of Manassas was fought,
and won by the Confederates.</p>

<p class='c000'>About sundown on the 18th the Eleventh Regiment
and Early's Brigade relieved the troops who
had been engaged, taking position along the run
above and below the ford, where they remained on
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui vive</span></i> all night and the next day, without
seeing or hearing of a single Yankee.</p>

<p class='c000'>The trees and bushes along and in the rear of the
line of battle were scarred by big and little shot. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>Yankees, being above on the bluff, overshot the
Confederates.</p>

<p class='c000'>Up on the bluff we saw the first dead Yankee—he
lay stark and cold in death upon the hillside
among the trees in the gloom of the gathering
twilight: the pale face turned towards us, upon
which we looked with feelings mingled with awe
and dread. We had heard and seen many new and
strange things that day. Later on in the war, we
could look upon the slain on the battlefield with little
less feeling than upon the carcass of an animal.
Such are some of the hardening effects of war. I
don't think we were again as badly scared as on that
day; I was not, I am sure.</p>

<p class='c000'>Longstreet's Brigade remained at and near Blackburn's
Ford all through the 19th and 20th of July,
waiting for and expecting another attack, discussing
the events of the battle, and conjecturing as to
what would be the next move in the game of war.
I remember talking with Lieut. Jim Hord of Company
H along this line, when he remarked, "There
will be a big battle Sunday—most all of the big fights
come off on Sunday." This prophecy came true.
The brigade had received its baptism of fire, the
nerves and mettle of the men had been tried, and
while it was a nerve-racking ordeal, yet all had stood
the test, so far as I remember, except one officer in
command of a company in the Eleventh Regiment,
whose nerve seemed to fail him. He was taken sick
and collapsed; was taken to the rear and never
returned to his company.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>I think if it had not been for pride and regard
for reputation, a good many of us would have been
like a negro cook in Company C: George, who belonged
to my brother-in-law, Robert Cocke, and had
been with the company as one of the cooks, brought
down from the camp at Manassas about noon on the
18th some cooked rations, and when the battle commenced,
was back in the rear near the hospital.
When the Yankee shells began to fall and burst in
his vicinity, George broke and ran for dear life back
to camp, stopping only long enough to say, "Dem
big balls come flying over me saying, 'Whar is you?
whar is you?' an' I lit out from dar in a hurry," and
away he went up the railroad track four miles to
Bristow Station. The boys laughed at George a
great many times about his ignominious flight;
George, however, never expressed a regret that he
took to his heels and made good time out of danger.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Confederate lines extended along the south
side of Bull Run about eight miles, that small and
insignificant stream having been chosen by General
Beauregard as his line of defense, instead of waiting,
as was expected by the inexperienced, for the
enemy to come on to Manassas, which position had
been fortified and the forts mounted with big guns.
Of course, the enemy would have never attacked this
place, but flanked it, viz., marched around the place
and forced the Confederates to evacuate. On Bull
Run the right of the Confederate lines was at Union
Mills, with General Ewell in command. Next up the
run was McLean's Ford, where General Jones and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>his brigade were posted. Next came Blackburn's
Ford, where, as before said, was posted Longstreet's
Brigade; then came General Bonham at Mitchell's
Ford with his brigade; next above this was Ball's
Ford, with Gen. Phillip St. George Cocke in command
of a brigade, and lastly the Stone Bridge, the
extreme Confederate left, in charge of General
Evans with his brigade. The general direction of
Bull Run is from west to east, or rather, from
northwest to southeast.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Holmes with his brigade and Colonel
Early with his brigade, and maybe others, were back
in reserve, and when Generals Jackson, Bee, and
Bartow arrived with their brigades, they were also
held in reserve. There were also batteries of
artillery along the lines near the several fords, with
cavalry on the flanks, and at intervals back from the
run.</p>

<p class='c000'>Along Bull Run, nearly all the way, grew trees
and bushes, and much of the ground back of the
stream on either side was covered with second-growth
pines and scrub-oaks, the ground being
rolling, though tolerably level.</p>

<p class='c000'>McDowell's command was concentrated at and
near Centreville, about a mile north of Bull Run,
and consisted of thirty-five or forty thousand men.
Beauregard had twelve or fifteen thousand men;
Gen. Jos. E. Johnston brought to his relief in the
very nick of time on the 21st some ten or twelve
thousand men.</p>

  <h2 id='CHAPTER_V' class='c004'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br /> <span class='sc'>The Battle of First Manassas—General Johnston<br /> to the Rescue—Gen. Kirby Smith<br /> Turns the Tide of Battle—The Rebel<br /> Yell—The News of Victory—The<br /> Enemy Not Pursued—Gathering<br /> the Spoils</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>On Sunday morning, the 21st of July, quite early,
on the left, up the run, the ball opened again, and
"partners, to your places," was the order, or in army
parlance, "Fall in!" "Attention!" The Yankee
General, McDowell, stole a march on General
Beauregard that morning.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beauregard had planned to take the aggressive,
by making an attack on McDowell's left near
Centreville, and when General Johnston reached
Beauregard about noon on the 20th, he approved the
plan; accordingly orders were issued that night to
begin the battle the next morning at sunrise. The
right wing of the Confederate forces was to cross
the run and attack the left wing of the Yankee
army. McDowell had also been doing some planning
himself, and as he got in the first lick,
frustrated the Confederate general's scheme.</p>

<p class='c000'>He, too, proposed to use his right arm in an attack
on the Confederate left wing. McDowell put his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>army in motion before daybreak on the morning of
the 21st of July, moving out from Centreville. A
small column of infantry, artillery and cavalry, in
battle array, marched out on the road leading to the
stone bridge, the Confederate left, and at daylight
formed line of battle and opened fire at long range,
while the main body of the army was making a
detour through the woods still higher up the run,
and crossing at Sudley's Ford two miles above the
stone bridge unopposed, marched down on the
Confederate left flank and rear. As soon as General
Evans, who was in command at the stone bridge, was
apprised of this movement on the left, he changed
front with a part of his brigade to meet the attack
and sent for reënforcements. Generals Bee and Bartow
first came to his relief, and in a short time the
battle was raging fiercely. Generals Johnston and
Beauregard hearing the firing to the left, and learning
the extent and object of this movement of the
enemy, at once abandoned their contemplated attack
with their right wing, and bent every energy to
resist the attack on their left. Beauregard went
immediately to the front and displayed great
gallantry, personally leading the troops in the
charge, while Johnston remained back to direct the
forwarding of the troops to reënforce the hard-pressed
left.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before sufficient reënforcements could reach the
scene of conflict, the heavy columns of the enemy
drove back the small forces confronting them. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>position at the stone bridge being flanked by the
enemy and abandoned by the Confederates, the
Yankee column in front of this position crossed over
and joined the flanking column of the enemy. Some
desperate fighting was done here, and noble deeds
of valor performed by men and officers never before
in battle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bee and Bartow, two young generals from South
Carolina and Alabama, won immortal fame, both
giving their lives to the cause on that (to them) fateful
day. Reënforcements were hurried forward as
fast as possible, but still the Confederate lines were
pressed slowly back, contesting every foot of
ground, which was covered in many places with
second-growth pines.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>GENERAL JOHNSTON TO THE RESCUE</h3>

<p class='c008'>By preärrangement, of which none but the chief
Confederate officers knew, Gen. Joseph E. Johnston,
who was confronting a Yankee army in the Valley
under General Patterson, who had orders to hold
Johnston in the Valley while McDowell attacked
Beauregard at Manassas, was to come to General
Beauregard's support at the proper time. And if
General McDowell stole a march on Beauregard on
the morning of the 21st, General Johnston had on
the 18th stolen a march on Patterson. On the 18th,
about noon, Johnston got word from Beauregard
that McDowell was in his front with an army much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>larger than his own, and that now was the time to
help. Johnston, who was then at Winchester, at
once put his army in motion up the Valley pike, then
marching across towards the Blue Ridge to Piedmont,
with Jackson's Brigade in the lead, which
marched seventeen miles that afternoon. Jackson
boarded the cars at Piedmont, and on the 20th by
noon was at Manassas, the other troops following.
Jackson, as before said, was placed in rear of the
line along Bull Run as a reserve, and now, at a
critical moment on the 21st, arrived on the battlefield,
and noting the situation, remarked, so it was
said, "We will give those people the bayonet," and
forming his brigade in line of battle, stood firmly
awaiting the propitious moment, as the Yankees were
ascending the pine-covered hill on which he and his
men stood. General Bee called on his broken and retreating
men of the far South to "rally on the Virginians."
"Look," exclaimed Bee to the South
Carolinians and Alabamians, "see Jackson and his
men standing like a stone wall!" Then and there
the sobriquet of "Stonewall" was given to this
demigod of war and his brigade, which will live
forever.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the Yankee line pressed up the hill, Jackson
charged, driving them back in confusion, thus giving
the first substantial check to the enemy, who had
pressed back the Confederate lines for a mile or
more.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>GEN. KIRBY SMITH TURNS THE TIDE OF BATTLE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>And there was to be another "Richmond on the
field," very soon. Generals Kirby Smith and Elzey,
of Johnston's command, were on the train on the
Manassas Gap road, hurrying as fast as steam could
carry them to Manassas Junction.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hearing the firing to the left and knowing that
the battle was not far away, instead of going on to
Manassas Junction, General Smith stopped the
trains before reaching that place, detrained the
troops, and following the rule of war, "marched
across the country to the sound of the heaviest
firing," struck the enemy on his flank, with a wild
yell that terrified the Yankees, and caused them to
break in great confusion.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Smith was shot from his horse, though
not killed. General Elzey, who, with his brigade,
had just arrived on the scene of action, then assumed
command, and pushing his troops still further
to the rear of the Yankee lines, completed the
rout.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such a rout and stampede as then and there
occurred has scarcely been equaled in the annals of
war. Of course, the Yankees had some troops back
towards Centreville and on the left of their line, who
were not routed and panic stricken, but I am quite
sure from what I afterwards heard, and saw the
next day, every mother's son of them who crossed
to the west or south side of Bull Run that day were
completely routed and demoralized.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>THE REBEL YELL</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>While a prisoner during the last year of the war,
I talked with a Yankee sergeant who was in the
battle, and asked him why they were so badly routed.
His answer was, "Well, when Kirby Smith came in
on our flank and raised that <em>yell</em>, we just thought
the Rebels were rising up out of the ground in those
pines, everywhere, when we broke and ran, and
never stopped until we crossed the Long Bridge into
Washington City." This Yankee laid stress on the
"yell." The Yankee cheering was done in unison
and in time. It was "hip, hip, huzza, huzza, huzza,"
which sounded coarse and harsh to the ear, while
the "Rebel yell" was one continuous shout of
mingled voices, without any intermission, unisonance
or time. Each man just opened his mouth as
wide as he could, strained his voice to the highest
pitch and yelled as long as his breath lasted, then
refilling the lungs, repeated it again and again. It
was a commingling of shrill, loud sounds, that rent
the air and could be heard for a distance of two
miles or more, often carrying terror to the enemy.
It was awe-inspiring to the Yankees, but joyous
sounds to the Confederates when victory was
achieved. The "Rebel yell" was a child of victory,
born that day on the plains of Manassas, and was
afterwards, by common consent, adopted as the
battle shout of the army of Northern Virginia.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>I have given at some length, principally from
hearsay, the main features of the battle on the left
of the Confederate lines, in order that what occurred
at and near Blackburn's Ford, where Longstreet's
Brigade was posted, may be better described and
understood.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the whole of this day, the Yankees kept
up a show of fight at Blackburn's Ford, in order to
prevent the Confederate troops on the right from
going to the relief of the hard-pressed left. Bonham,
Holmes, Ewell, Early (except the Twenty-fourth
Regiment, which remained at Blackburn's
Ford), and Cocke, or the greater part of these
brigades, were sent to the left. Early was late in
getting upon the scene of action, owing to the miscarriage
of the order for him to move, which was,
from some unknown cause, delayed three hours. He
rendered good service, however, pressing still further
on the enemy's right and rear than Kirby Smith
and Elzey had done. Jones and Longstreet remained
at McLean's and Blackburn's Ford.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>UNDER SHELLING</h3>

<p class='c008'>Throughout the whole day the Yankees shelled
these positions at intervals of every five or ten
minutes.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the afternoon the two brigades and the
Twenty-fourth Regiment crossed over the run,
formed in column of regiments and lay down in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>the woods, expecting every moment to be ordered
forward and charge the battery in front, the shells
from which were continually bursting among the
tree-tops, cutting off branches, these, and the fragments
of shells, falling around, now and then striking
some one.</p>

<p class='c000'>I remember how sleepy I was, lying there in the
woods that hot July day, often dozing between the
shots. We had slept but little the past three nights.
The boom of the guns, the scream of the shells, the
dull thud of the pieces striking the ground and sometimes
a man, was enough to awake the dead almost,
and made all lie low and hug mother earth pretty
closely, but still I dozed between shots.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is surprising how close men can get to the
ground when lying under a good, brisk shelling;
great affection seems to be manifested for the dust,
from which all sprung. At such times, a lizard,
when rocked by a boy, never laid flatter on a fence
rail than the soldiers lay on the ground. It was
afterwards said, that orders were sent Jones and
Longstreet to advance on the enemy's left near
Centreville, but the order was not delivered; it was
conjectured that the messenger was killed by a shell.</p>

<p class='c000'>All day at Blackburn's Ford we could hear the
battle raging up the run to the left; the booming of
cannon, the explosion of the shells, and the noise of
the musketry could be distinctly heard.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sometimes the sounds would die down, the
musketry firing amounting to little more than a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>sharp skirmish; then again the noise of the battle
would rise higher and louder, sometimes drawing
nearer and then recede and die down almost entirely,
then fiercely rise again, while the loud peals of the
battery in our front waked the echoes far and near.
All this time the strain and suspense were terrible;
no tidings as to how the battle was going came to
us; no news came, only the roar of the battle two or
three miles away could be heard. I thought this
fight was the biggest that had ever occurred in the
history of the world; others were of the same
opinion. Col. Bob Preston in the midst of the battle
remarked to Colonel Withers, as I heard Colonel
Withers relate afterwards, that "the battle of
Waterloo was a mere skirmish to it." I could not
conceive on the 18th, while the fighting was in
progress, how any could escape where so much shooting
was going on. And, now on this, the 21st, the
shooting was going on all day.</p>

<p class='c000'>What must be the result! How many dead and
dying were lying on the field of strife? Were our
friends getting the best of the fight, or were the
Yankees going to be victorious? How soon would
we be called into action, and charge through the
open fields up "to the very cannon's mouth"? And
what would be the result? Would we capture the
battery and drive away the infantry support, or be
repulsed and driven back? Who and how many
would be left on the field wounded, bleeding, dying
and dead? All this and much more we had time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>to think of on that hot, never-to-be-forgotten 21st
day of July, 1861. This was one of the days that
the sun seemed to stand still, or move slower than
usual. I never saw our company, regiment or
brigade falter in battle or fail to respond to any
call, but I never saw them "eager for the fight," as
it is sometimes expressed. My observation of men,
and my own feelings on the eve of the battle, going
into the fight, or in the midst of strife, was that the
bravest realized the danger and dreaded the fiery
ordeal, yet did their duty when bidden.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. W. H. Taylor in his "Experiences of an
Assistant Surgeon," says, "I freely admit that I was
never in a battle but that I should have felt the most
exultant joy if I had been out of it." I freely
concur in this statement as to myself and all whom
I observed in battle.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE NEWS OF VICTORY</h3>

<p class='c008'>At last, as the sun was sinking over the western
hills, and the shadows lengthening, tidings from the
battlefield came, and joyful news it was.</p>

<p class='c000'>The firing had just ceased, except now and then
a cannon shot in the distance; the battery in our
front had ceased firing—there was an ominous
silence; the very air around us, hot and sultry as it
was, seemed surcharged with something more than
summer heat and sulphuric fumes from exploding
shells. Every man was now on his feet, all nerves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>were strung to the highest pitch; every one, from the
highest officer to the humblest private, wore a look
of intense anxiety, all in silent expectancy. What
did all this portend? Was it a calm before a
mightier storm than we had heard during the day,
that was about to burst? Or had the storm already
spent itself, and what was the result? Or had the
contestants in the deadly all-day strife up the run
been exhausted, and lay limp and impotent on the
ground, unable to strike another blow, the one at
the other? Or had they, like the Kilkenny cats,
devoured each other, leaving none to tell the tale?</p>

<p class='c000'>As the noise of battle died away, from away up
the run we heard shouts and cheers, at first scarcely
audible, then louder and nearer came the cheers,
rolling along down the valley of Bull Run in seeming
waves of mingled voices, each wave rising
higher and more distinct. Messengers mounted on
fleet-footed steeds, which that day had become war
horses that sniffed the smoke of battle, not "from
afar," but on the very field of strife and carnage,
hurried down the lines along the run, shouting,
"Victory! victory! victory; complete victory!"
Each detachment took up the joyous shout and
wafted it on to those below. From Mitchell's Ford,
just above us, where Bonham and his South
Carolinians on the 18th held the fort and let fly the
dogs of war on the enemy's flank, Longstreet's
Brigade caught the inspiration and raised its first
"Rebel yell" that made the welkin ring, and sent the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>glad and glorious news on down to Jones and his
men at McLean's Ford, and quickly came the echo
back in ringing peals.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then details of the victory began to come in.
The enemy was completely routed; many prisoners
and many guns had been captured. Then it came
that "Long Tom," a noted Yankee cannon, was
captured; then that Sherman's Battery, the crack
artillery of the United States Army, was taken; then
that Rickett's, another noted battery, and also Griffin's,
had all been captured. The first mentioned
battery, with Capt. W. T. Sherman in command,
won laurels in the Mexican War, and had been
known ever since as Sherman's Battery.</p>

<p class='c000'>Longstreet at once led his brigade forward into
the open field, at the farther side of which was a
redoubt with abattis in front, where had been stationed
the Yankee guns that shelled us all day.
How different were our feelings now from what
they would have been if we had entered this field
during the day, and been met by a shower of shot,
shell, grape and canister! Now, we were without
fear, exultant and in high spirits; before, we would
have been rent with missiles of death, great gaps
would have been torn through the column of regiments,
and many would have been left wounded
and dead on the field.</p>

<p class='c000'>The brigade marched on into the woods beyond
the field towards Centreville, bivouacking on the
ground of a Yankee camp, which the enemy had just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>abandoned, leaving evidences of hasty departure;
coffee, sugar, hard-tack, and many articles of food
and equipments lay scattered around. Some of the
men shouted, "Don't eat them things, they may be
pizened." Later on the "pizen" was not for a
moment considered when a Yankee camp was
raided, and when many a hungry Rebel ate to his
full once more.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the Eleventh Regiment was taking position in
camp for the night, General Longstreet, "Old Pete,"
as he was sometimes called, rode close by, when
Colonel Garland called on the men of the Eleventh
to give three cheers for General Longstreet, which
were given with a will, then some one, Captain
Clement, I think, called out, "Three cheers for
Colonel Garland," and again the shouts were raised.
Warnings were sent not to use the water from Bull
Run; it was said the stream up about the stone
bridge was filled with dead Yankees and overflowing
its banks from the obstructions of the bodies.
This was a great exaggeration; in fact, few, if any,
Yankees were dead in the stream.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Yankee army was in full retreat, and more;
the larger part of it was in complete rout and panic.
The cry of "On to Richmond" was quickly changed
to "Back to Washington."</p>

<p class='c000'>A soldier, unless panic stricken, will hold on to his
gun to the last; only when completely demoralized
does he cast away his weapon of offense and defense,
then he is little more than a frightened animal. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>army of Northern Virginia was never panic stricken.
General Lee said, "My men sometimes fail to drive
the enemy, but the enemy does not drive my men,"
which was literally true up to the very beginning of
the end, or rather, if the expression is permissible,
up to the very ending of the end. Let the mind run
back over the long list of desperate encounters that
this army had with the enemy during those four
bloody years, and this will be found to be literally
true.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE ENEMY NOT PURSUED</h3>

<p class='c008'>Much has been said about the failure of a vigorous
pursuit of the enemy at and immediately after this
battle of Manassas. Without going into details or
giving reasons in <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in extenso</span></i> for my opinion, I have
always contended that Johnston and Beauregard
acted wisely and prudently under all the circumstances.
No one in the Confederate army at the
close of that day knew or had any means of knowing
how panic stricken the Yankee soldiers really
were. There were several thousand soldiers in and
around Centreville, who had not been engaged, in
position and condition to resist a pursuit by any
force the Confederates could have sent against them
that night; it's a very risky business to pursue a
retreating army in the night time; traps, ambuscades,
and surprises are easily planned and executed,
into which the rash pursuers are sure to fall. A
large majority of the Confederate troops had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>marching or fighting, or both, all day, many without
rations, and were in no condition to pursue the
enemy ten, fifteen or twenty miles that night. The
bulk of the fleeing enemy had gotten several miles
away, and was still going, before it could have been
possible to organize anything like a systematic and
immediate pursuit. Even if the enemy had had no
organized rear guard, it would have been one mob
pursuing another mob.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Confederate army could not have possibly
reached the vicinity of the Potomac River opposite
Washington City before the next day, and then not
before noon. Here all approaches were well
fortified, mounted with siege guns and manned, and
the capture of Washington would have been an
impossibility.</p>

<p class='c000'>So then, away with the cry then raised by bomb-proof
generals in editors' chairs a hundred miles or
more away, and, as has been since often repeated,
that "if Johnston and Beauregard had pursued, or if
Jeff Davis, who came upon the scene of action late
in the afternoon, had not prevented a pursuit, Washington
could have been captured and the war then
and there ended." I did not believe then, have not
since, nor now believe, that any such thing could
have been accomplished.</p>

<p class='c000'>And above and far beyond all opinions and
speculations on this question is the fact, that Joseph
E. Johnston, G. T. Beauregard, and Jefferson Davis
were all on the ground, and if these three men, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>all their experience, wisdom and information did not
know what was the right thing to do, who could,
would, or should have known?</p>

<p class='c000'>In this battle the losses were nothing like as large
as expected, when all was summed up. The Confederate
loss was estimated at a little less than four
hundred killed and not quite fifteen hundred
wounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>The enemy lost about five hundred killed, one
thousand wounded, and about fifteen hundred
prisoners.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Confederates captured many pieces of
cannon, thousands of small arms, accoutrements,
camp equipage, etc.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>GATHERING THE SPOILS</h3>

<p class='c008'>On the next day, the 22d of July, Longstreet's
Brigade was detailed to scour the country between
Centreville and the Stone Bridge to secure the cast-away
arms and equipments the Yankees left in their
wild flight from the battlefield. The whole brigade
was deployed, as if in skirmish line, on either side of
the Warrenton turnpike, converging as it moved
on to the crossing at the Stone Bridge. The greater
part of the day was spent in picking up muskets,
cartridge-boxes, belts, knapsacks, haversacks, canteens,
coats, hats, blankets, etc. It was a dark,
drizzly, foggy day, much of the way through second
growth pines. I remember as we were crouching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>beneath the low-hanging branches of the pines late
in the afternoon, some of Company C were considerably
startled by a cry of "halt." It proved
to be a little Yankee soldier, a mere youth, who was
hatless and had been wounded in the head, which
was bound up with a bloody bandage. He had been
in hiding since the day before in the pine thicket,
presenting a forlorn appearance as he crept out
from his hiding place. He had called out "halt,"
doubtless from habit formed while on guard duty,
to attract attention. He was not badly wounded
and was taken along and turned over to the provost
guard who had charge of the prisoners.</p>

<p class='c000'>Crossing over the stone bridge, the brigade went
into camp for the night at the top of the long hill
on the Warrenton pike, on a part of the battlefield
where there were many dead horses and men, broken
cannon carriages, caissons, and ammunition wagons.</p>

<p class='c000'>Along the road between the stone bridge and
Centreville much flotsam and jetsam, cast-away and
abandoned things, lay strewn around on all sides.
Large numbers of people, men and women, had
followed in the wake of the army to witness the
battle, and to join in the "On to Richmond," which
all expected to follow at once. It was currently
reported and believed among the Yankee soldiers
and people of the North that the "Rebel army" was
but a half-organized mob, armed only with flint-lock
muskets and shotguns that could be easily brushed
out of the way. Great preparations had been made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>for a big ball in the city of Richmond within the
next few days. Many carriages filled with women,
with all their ball costumes, were also along; Congressmen
and other dignitaries came from Washington
to witness the battle, and see the "Rebels
run"; wagons and carts loaded with baskets of
wines, liquors, and other things; stacks of pound-cake,
confectioneries and fruits, oranges, lemons, etc.
During the day, while the "Rebels" were being
driven back, these spectators followed along the
road and drew near the stone bridge, all, no doubt,
in high feather and glee with much eating and
drinking, and watched the scenes at the front.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the tide of battle turned and the stream
of flying Yankee soldiers, artillery, caissons, ammunition
wagons and ambulances came rushing
back, these spectators, in dismay and horror, turned
to fly, but the mad rush of the army fleeing was
upon them; no respect was paid to sex or person.
It was, "Every man for himself and the devil take
the hindermost."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Confederate batteries galloped to the top of
the hill south of the run and sent shells screaming
along the road. The cavalry crossed the stone bridge
and dashed into the rearmost ranks, all causing confusion
worst confounded. Carriages, carts and
wagons were upset, their occupants and contents
dumped out and scattered along the road. Some of
these civilians were taken prisoners, including Congressman
Eli, of percussion-cap fame, whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>carriage had broken down or overturned; I think
he was taken to Richmond and soon afterwards
released, and returned to Washington, doubtless a
wiser, if not a better man. At the stone bridge a
wagon or gun-carriage had been overturned or
broken down; here there was a perfect jam of all
kinds of vehicles that blocked the bridge.</p>

<p class='c000'>After this our men were much better supplied
with guns, cartridge-boxes, haversacks, canteens,
knapsacks, oilcloths, blankets, and many other
things; and all during the war until the last year,
1865, the Yankees supplied Lee's army with such
things, leaving them laying around loose on almost
every battlefield.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day the brigade marched back to camp
at Manassas, passing over much of the battlefield,
where still lay among the scrub-pines many swollen,
blackened corpses yet unburied, though details were
at work at the gruesome task. Conspicuous among
the dead bodies could be seen the New York Zouaves
with flashy uniforms and red fez with tassel, loose,
red knee-pants and long stockings; big stalwart
fellows they were, with bronzed faces and necks,
but now they lay dead upon the battlefield. And
doubtless some, if not all of us, in the words of the
"good old Rebel," "wished we'd killed some more."</p>

<p class='c000'>These men had invaded Virginia with guns in
their hands, and we knew they had met their just
deserts. Virginia and the South only wanted to be
let alone; peacefully to withdraw from the compact,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>leaving the states north of Mason and Dixon's
line with their "Union and their Flag," to cherish
and love as they pleased. Only this and nothing
more. But the North would not, as Horace Greeley
advised, "Let their erring sisters of the South depart
in peace." Instead, they waged upon the South a
most cruel and devastating war. The Yankees are
still charging that the South tried to break up the
United States Government. This is a false charge.
The South made no attack on the United States
Government. The South only attempted to get from
under the yoke of the North and be a free people.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>On the 24th of July, the brigade broke camp
at Manassas and marched to Centreville, where the
Eleventh Regiment pitched its tents, just on the
outskirts of that little hamlet of a few houses.</p>

<p class='c000'>Other troops were camped round about, all in
fine spirits, fast learning to be soldiers, always keeping
up the drills, company and regimental. Colonel
Garland was a fine drill officer and had the regiment
well drilled. While here General Longstreet had
brigade drills a few times, but this did not amount to
much, and was never tried again. In battle the
maneuvers practiced in drilling were seldom used;
but drilling learned the men to keep together, rally
and get into line quickly when separated. In battle
few orders were heard except "fall into line," "load,"
"commence firing," "cease firing," "forward,"
"charge," and the like. Sometimes, but not often,
in the army of Northern Virginia, the command
was heard, "fall back."</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>ADVANCE TO FAIRFAX COURT HOUSE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>On the 10th of August, 1861, the brigade moved
to Fairfax Court House, seven miles. The day was
intensely hot, and many fell by the wayside, going
into camp just north of the town; not a very desirable
camping ground, as it was rather low and flat. It
rained a good deal and there was a great deal of sickness,
measles, typhoid fever, and diarrhea. It was
surprising how many men had never had measles; it
seemed that half or more of the army had the
disease the first year of the war, and large numbers
died from the effects. Typhoid fever frequently
followed the measles, often proving fatal. While
here my brother Coon had measles which was
followed by fever. He was taken to the field
hospital near camp, and after remaining there in a
tent a few days, Dr. Thornhill said if he was not
sent away he would die. I immediately went to work
and got a sick-furlough for him, carried him to
Manassas in an ambulance, put him on the train the
next day on a mattress and started him for Lynchburg;
he was too sick and weak to sit up, but I
could not go with him. On the train, as good fortune
would have it, was the Rev. H. M. Linney, a
Methodist preacher, who was or had been the year
before on the Campbell County circuit. Mr. Linney
acted the part of the Good Samaritan and ministered
to his wants until the train reached Lynchburg,
where he was met by my brother-in-law, Mr. Geo.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>A. Burks, to whom I had wired. Mr. Burks took
him to his house where he had a long and severe
spell of fever.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>PICKET CLOSE TO ENEMY—EXCITING TIMES</h3>

<p class='c008'>After the brigade moved to Fairfax Court House,
we did a great deal of picket duty down towards
Alexandria and Washington City, close to the
enemy's line. We were sometimes in sight of the
dome of the capital, and could see the Yankees drilling
on the high hills on the south side of the Potomac
River. The Yankees often had a balloon up in the
air, anchored by a long cable, at which a cannon
shot would sometimes be fired, and a shot brought
it down. This shot, I think, was fired by Lieut.
Thos. L. Rosser, afterwards General Rosser. The
principal picket posts were at Mason's, Munson's
and Upton's Hill's, Falls Church, and near
Annandale.</p>

<p class='c000'>One night Company C, and a cavalry company
commanded by Captain —— Carter, were on picket
near Annandale, close to the enemy's line, when, about
midnight, a squad of Company C, on outpost duty,
came in to the reserve post, and reported that a body
of cavalry was approaching along the road by which
we had come from Centreville. It was at once
conjectured that the Yankee cavalry had, by another
road, flanked our position, gotten in the rear and
was attempting to bag the Confederate pickets.
Captains Clement and Carter made disposition of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>the two companies to give the enemy a warm
reception. Company C was posted along the fence
by the roadside, while Captain Carter formed his
company in the field a short distance in the rear.
Instructions were given to the men to let the cavalry
approaching pass along the road until the head of
the column reached the extreme right of our line,
and then, at a signal from Captain Clement, to open
fire on them, when Captain Carter and his company
would charge; this was the plan and instructions in
case the approaching horsemen proved to be, as was
believed, Yankees.</p>

<p class='c000'>The night was dark; objects could be distinguished
only a few feet away. In silence we anxiously
awaited the coming of the approaching cavalrymen,
the noise of whose horses' hoofs we soon heard coming
down the hill; the suspense was intense. Every
man had his gun at a "ready," determined, at the
proper signal, to pour a volley into the enemy, who,
when along the road in our immediate front, would
not be more than ten feet from the muzzles of the
guns. On, the horsemen came in silence, right along
in our front; each man clutched his musket tighter;
not a word or whisper was uttered, until the front
files of the column had reached the right of the
line, when Captain Clement, who had taken position
at that point, called out in his deep bass voice, in a
firm tone, "Halt! Who comes there?" In an
instant the horsemen came to a standstill and the
answer to the challenge came from the front files,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>"Friends, with the countersign;" whereupon
Captain Clement called out, "Advance one and give
the countersign." One of the men came up and in
a low tone gave the word, which, as I remember,
was "Richmond." Captain Clement at once called
out, "Countersign correct, advance, friends," and
the scare was over, and each party felt much
relieved.</p>

<p class='c000'>Explanations followed, which developed that this
company had been sent down to strengthen the picket
post, and had not taken the precaution to send a
single horseman in front to notify us of their
coming.</p>

<p class='c000'>These men thought, they said, when they were
halted and heard the click of some of our men's
musket locks, as they made ready to fire, that they
were right in the midst of the Yankees. If a single
shot had been fired by either side (and it is often
hard to restrain men under such circumstances),
there would have been many friends slain by friends.
I think this was after we moved back to Centreville
in the fall.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another, and for a time rather serious, but in
the end, amusing incident occurred while on picket
near Falls Church. Here the lines were close together
and the pickets often in sight of each other.
The picket forces were heavy, sometimes with a
battery of artillery along. On one occasion the
Yankees had a post in a house a few hundred yards
away, across a wooded ravine, and the captain of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>battery concluded he would shell this Yankee post.
Company C was drawn up in line, near by, as a
support in case the Yankees made a dash to capture
the guns. Two guns were let loose on the house,
and it was fun to watch the Yankees scamper out
and take to their heels. Pretty soon some one said,
"Don't you hear the Yankees bringing up their guns?
They are going to shell us." This changed the humor
of the men very quickly from hilarity and good feelings
to solemnity and anxiety for their own safety.
Just as it was expected the Yankee guns were about
to open fire, one of the men, looking pretty nervous
and rather pale about the gills, like most of us,
turned to Captain Clement and said with earnestness,
"I don't think it is <em>far</em> to have cannon on
picket." It was great fun to see the Yankees skedaddle,
but quite another thing to be shelled. The
Yankees did not shell us, but we laughed at Peter
Cary many times afterwards about this remark.</p>

<p class='c000'>While on picket down there at Falls Church we
fared fine. I remember some of us would go every
morning to a house for breakfast, where we feasted
on buckwheat cakes, butter, honey and milk.</p>

<p class='c000'>Near Mason's Hill, at a picket post, there was a
large farm occupied by a Yankee, who had abandoned
it upon the approach of the Confederates, and
gone within the Yankee lines, leaving a fine
garden, large cornfields, fruit, etc. The soldiers
were told these things had been confiscated by the
Confederate authorities for their use, on account of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>the disloyalty of the owner, and they fairly feasted
on roasting-ears, potatoes, tomatoes, etc.,—boiling
camp kettles full of potatoes and corn. Some of
the men would eat as many as twelve or fourteen
ears of corn at one time; Ned Gilliam, I believe,
was the champion corn eater, and Tom and Jabe
Rosser, Sam Franklin, the Tweedy and Jones boys,
and others, were close seconds. I think maybe they
appropriated some bee-gums, or their contents, and
perhaps some jars of preserves and other sweets.
I must say that Company C had very few men in it
who would forage illegally. On one occasion a year
or two afterwards, I suspected some of the company
of killing a hog while down in the south-side
of Virginia, though I did not know it, and took no
pains to investigate, as meat was very scarce about
that time: in fact, we had none, and it was right
hard for a soldier to let a hog bite him and not kill
it when hungry. I have heard soldiers say that they
would kill a sheep if it tried to bite them. Some of
the boys told a story on R. H. Jones about eating,
or rather, not eating "stolen hog." Bob was quite
young and very conscientious. On one occasion his
mess had fresh pork for breakfast which they did
not draw from the commissary. When the chops
were fried brown and crisp, the boys gathered
around the frying-pan and began eating. Bob sat
aloof, munching on his corn pone, when some one
said, "Bob, have some meat." "No," drawled Bob,
"I don't eat stolen hog," all the while looking at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>pan and nibbling away on his dry bread. Again
some one said, "Bob, you better have some, it's
mighty good." Bob reached over towards the pan
with his bread and said, "I won't eat any of the
meat, but will take a little of the gravy."</p>

<p class='c000'>While encamped around Fairfax Court House,
the whole army was thrown into a high fever of
excitement one day by the beating of the long roll.
Under the army regulations the long roll is never
beaten except in cases of emergency—the sudden and
unexpected attack or approach of the enemy. When
the long roll is sounded it is the duty of every drum
corps in hearing to take it up and repeat it, and every
man is hastily called to arms. On this occasion the
long roll was started without cause by a <em>fresh</em>
"officer of the day," as he said, "to see what effect
it would have." For miles around the drums rolled
and there was much hurrying and scurrying of staff
officers and couriers. I think the "officer of the day"
got a court-martial for his freshness, and very
likely, if "old Jube" had the say-so, a good <em>cussing</em>.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>BACK TO CENTREVILLE</h3>

<p class='c008'>On the 19th or 20th of October, 1861, the army
moved back to Centreville and went into camp—the
Eleventh Regiment on the same ground it had
before occupied.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole army was encamped round about and
along Bull Run; rations were plentiful and the men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>passed a very comfortable winter, making pipes and
trinkets from ivy roots dug up along Bull Run,
which had now become historic.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Fifth Louisian Regiment was camped about
one-half mile from the Eleventh Virginia. The
Louisian Regiment had a fine band, and every afternoon
would play many patriotic pieces, including
"Dixie," "The Bonnie Blue Flag," etc. The
Eleventh Regiment also had a very good band, led
by Geo. W. Lyman, of Lynchburg.</p>

<p class='c000'>We still picketed down close to Fairfax Court
House. While on picket there during the winter I
was taken with break-bone fever and sent home on
a sick furlough. It was a rainy time, and I slept one
night on a pile of rails, and the next morning every
bone in my body was aching. I remember telling
old Dr. Withers of this after I got home, when he
remarked, "Sleeping on rails is well calculated to
make one's bones ache." I had never seen our
little boy, Dixie, who was born on the 25th of
September, 1861, and was then about five months
old. He was a fine little fellow, and a great comfort
to his mother in my absence. Of course, we all
enjoyed the home-coming.</p>

<p class='c000'>While I was away the regiment went on a foraging
expedition, in support of Stuart's Cavalry, north
of Centreville. Near Drainesville they got into a
fight with the Yankees, when Wm. H. Hobson, of
Company C, a cousin of my wife, was mortally
wounded, being shot through the bowels, dying soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>afterwards. He was the first man of Company C
killed. Lieut. H. C. Chalmers, of Company A, lost
an arm in this fight.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as I was well again, I returned to the
army, which was still at Centreville, where it remained
for some time.</p>

<p class='c000'>While in camp here, Governor Letcher visited
the army and presented each Virginia Regiment with
a new State flag. The troops were all drawn up
around one of the forts, the colonels going up into
the fort, the Governor making a speech to each as
he presented the flags, and the colonels, on receiving
them, replying. I remember Col. Eppa Hunton, of
the Eighth Virginia, said in his speech, "Every man
in Fauquier County shall be carried home feet foremost
before his flag will be surrendered." I think
this was the summer or fall before or during our
first encampment at Centreville.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Gen. Joseph E. Johnston had been for some
time sole commander of the army, General Beauregard
having been ordered south some months before.
Gen. George B. McClellan, who succeeded General
McDowell, was in command of the Yankee army,
and had been all winter recruiting, reorganizing,
equipping and drilling what he claimed to be "the
finest army on the planet," some 125,000 strong.
When winter began to break, General Johnston knew
his adversary would soon move against him, and
thinking it not prudent to stand his ground at
Centreville or Manassas, against so powerful an
army, with only about 40,000 men, just as McClellan
was preparing to advance, the Confederate
army, on the 9th of March, 1862, broke camp,
having first made dummy cannons of wood, painted
black, mounting them in the forts and redoubts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>around Centreville, also dummy soldiers, in order
to deceive and delay the enemy. The army retired
leisurely at first, stopping several days at a time
in camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>The terms of enlistment of most of the Confederate
troops were about to expire, and the men
were called upon to reenlist for the war, which
nearly all did. On this march, while in camp a few
days, Company C elected officers to take the place
of those who had been at first elected and whose
terms would expire about the 1st of May. Captain
Clement was reëlected captain, I was elected first
lieutenant, James Connelly was reëlected second
lieutenant, and Jabez R. Rosser was elected third
lieutenant. J. A. Hobson and H. H. Withers, first
and second lieutenants, not being reëlected, left the
company at the end of their terms. About this time
the company received a number of recruits, the militiamen
up to thirty-five years old having been called
out and given the privilege of joining the companies
of their choice. The recruits were mostly married
men, from twenty-five to thirty-five years old.</p>

<p class='c000'>McClellan did not essay to follow Johnston, but
determined to change his base and plan of campaign
from Northern Virginia to the Peninsula. His army
was accordingly embarked on transports, sailing
down the Potomac and Chesapeake Bay, landing at
the lower end of the Peninsula at Fortress Monroe.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as General Johnston was aware of this
move, he put his army in motion and marched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>rapidly to Richmond. The march was through
Prince William, Spottsylvania, Hanover, and
Henrico counties, into Richmond, where we arrived
on the 12th of April, 1862. This march was very
laborious, through rain and mud, the troops often
marching through fields to avoid the muddy roads,
and to give place to the trains of artillery and baggage
and commissary wagons. At that time each
regiment had thirteen wagons, but never again after
the Peninsula campaign; after that year about three
was the limit.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was the first real hard marching we had
done. Some of the men gave out on the route, and
had to be hauled in wagons and ambulances; many
had their knapsacks hauled. Only one man of
Company C besides myself carried their knapsacks,
blankets and guns through without any help.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE PENINSULA CAMPAIGN</h3>

<p class='c008'>On arriving at Richmond on the 12th of April
the troops were embarked on boats, steamed down
the James to King's Landing, seven miles from
Williamsburg, marching through that quaint and
dilapidated old town, on down the Peninsula to the
lines near Yorktown, where General Magruder was
in command with fifteen or twenty thousand men,
confronting McClellan and his "grand army" on the
lines stretching across the Peninsula from the York
to the James. McClellan had 125,000 men; Johnston
about 50,000, all told.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>The lines, at the point the Eleventh Regiment
faced the Yankees, were about one thousand yards
apart; at other places the lines were much closer,
and there were frequent skirmishes and sharp-shooting.
Forts at intervals along the lines were
mounted with big guns, and shots were often exchanged.</p>

<p class='c000'>One day I was standing behind one of the Confederate
guns, when a shot from a thirty-two-pounder
was fired at a Yankee fort one thousand
yards off, across an open level field, and saw the ball,
a black mass, as it sped across the field, go right into
the fort and explode. Of course, we could not
see from that distance what damage was done, but
heard afterwards from prisoners that this shell
played havoc in the Yankee fort, killing and wounding
men right and left, and tearing up things generally.
This was a splendid shot, aimed and the
fuse timed exactly right; it went to the very spot desired,
exploding at the very second to do the most
damage. The Yankees did not return the fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>The service on the Peninsula was arduous and
disagreeable; in the muddy trenches, or back in the
woods, lying on the rain-soaked ground, or marching
along the cut-up and muddy roads, was trying
indeed, and caused no little sickness among the
troops. Harvey Bailey, of Company C, died of disease
while here. One night while the regiment lay
back in the woods, the men sleeping on their arms,
that is, every man lying with his gun by his side, instead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>of being stacked, there was a night alarm, with
sharp musketry firing along the trenches; all were
aroused and under arms in a moment. It was a
cloudy, pitch-dark night, and we did not know what
the trouble was. Just as the firing ceased the hooting
of a big owl was heard in the distance. "There now,"
was whispered along the lines, "we are cut off;
that is a Yankee signal." Nothing came of it,
however, except a good scare. When soldiers are
thus suddenly aroused at night by a call to arms, it
causes a chilling sensation, and they shake like one
with the "buck ague."</p>

<p class='c000'>General Johnston was often seen riding along the
lines, sitting his horse very erect, and presenting a
soldierly appearance. He always reminded me of
a gamecock trimmed and gaffed ready for the main.
While here our first year of enlistment expired, and
I entered upon the duties of first lieutenant; I had
been orderly sergeant up to this time, carrying a
musket.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>YORKTOWN LINES EVACUATED</h3>

<p class='c008'>General Johnston, getting information that McClellan
was preparing to send a force by transports
up York River to West Point, and which he, Johnston,
had no means of preventing, and thus get in his
rear and between him and Richmond, it was determined
to evacuate the Yorktown line of defense.
Accordingly, about the 3d or 4th of May, 1862, the
trenches were evacuated and the whole army began
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>falling back up the Peninsula, the wagons and
artillery in front. The Yankees made a landing at
West Point, but were driven back to their transports
by a force sent to meet them. As we marched up
the Peninsula we could hear the booming of the big
guns in this fight.</p>

<p class='c000'>The roads were in wretched condition, muddy
and badly cut up by the long trains of wagons and
artillery, making the march very trying and disagreeable,
for it rained nearly every day about this time.
No one who has not marched on foot behind army
wagon and artillery trains has any conception of
what muddy roads are. Horses and mules were
sometimes literally buried in the mud and left to
perish, or shot dead on the spot.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is surprising how much fatigue and hardship
men can stand when put to it. Soldiers were often
put to the supreme test of endurance, and, no doubt,
many an old Confederate soldier often says to himself,
"How did we stand those long, tiresome
marches, through the rain and mud of spring,
through the dust and heat of summer, and midst
snow and ice of winter, often poorly shod, scantily
clothed, and on short, very short rations, sometimes
none at all." A man can stand more than a horse.
But the Confederate soldiers did stand these things,
enduring more, perhaps, than any soldiers ever endured
before. It took men to do these things—men
with muscles, sinews, and nerves in their bodies, and
courage in their hearts; and then, on the battlefield,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>to meet the foe two, three, and four to one,
and vanquish that foe, took men of the highest
valor. Of such was the Confederate soldier. The
service of our Revolutionary fathers was not comparable
to the arduous trials and privations of the
Confederate soldiers. The privations and suffering
of the army at Valley Forge during the winter of
1777-78 was as nothing to the experiences of the
Confederates around Petersburg during the winter
of 1864-5.</p>

<p class='c000'>On February 8, 1865, General Lee wrote to the
Secretary of War to this effect: "For three days and
nights the right wing of the army has been in line
of battle; some of the men have had no meat for
three days, and all suffering from reduced rations
and scant clothing, exposed to the fire of the enemy,
cold, hail and sleet." About the same time General
Lee issued a circular letter to the farmers in the
surrounding country, beseeching them to "loan the
army all the cornmeal and sorghum they could
spare." But I am anticipating, so back to the
Peninsula.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>BATTLE OF WILLIAMSBURG</h3>

<p class='c008'>I should have stated before, that about the time
the army fell back from Centreville and Manassas,
General Longstreet was promoted to major-general,
and Col. A. P. Hill of the Thirteenth Virginia Regiment
was promoted to brigadier-general, and
assigned to Longstreet's old brigade, which now
formed a part of Longstreet's Division.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>On the afternoon of the 4th of May, the brigade
marched through the town of Williamsburg; slept
on their arms in an open field just west of the town.
Early next morning it was evident to all that a fight
was on hand—staff officers and couriers were riding
hither and thither in great haste. McClellan was
pressing on General Johnston's rear a little too
closely to suit him, and Johnston determined to give
him a taste of what was in store for him later on.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hill's Brigade, as well as other troops, infantry
and artillery, were marched back through the town.
Just at the eastern limits of the town the brigade
turned off the road to the right, through the fields,
and was massed in a deep hollow. Other troops
were known to be in the woods a few hundred yards
in front, and we were in position as their support.</p>

<p class='c000'>Other troops had passed on down the Yorktown
road towards Fort McGruder, and the other forts
east of Williamsburg, some of which the Confederates
had abandoned. I remember Latham's
Battery dashing by, as we marched through the
streets, at a gallop. Latham's Battery was from
Lynchburg, and the men well known to many of the
Eleventh Regiment. Some one in the Eleventh called
out to them as they passed, asking if they were
going into the fight. "Yes," shouted back Jim Ley,
one of the battery; "Latham's Battery is always in
the fight." Artillery firing could already be heard
at the front. As the men passed along the streets,
they unslung their knapsacks, depositing them in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>the front yards of the houses on the street—stripping
for the fight. There were no forts or breastworks
in our front, nor was there any artillery with
the brigade or with the troops in front. The position
was the extreme right of the Confederate lines.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE BATTLE BEGINS</h3>

<p class='c008'>We did not have to wait long. Sharp musketry
firing soon commenced in the woods—lasting only
a short time, however. About the time the firing
ceased, the brigade was ordered forward, not in
line of battle, but marching by the flank. As we
entered the woods Gen. Roger A. Pryor and a few
men came out and moved off to the left, along the
edge of the field. Soon after getting into the woods
the brigade was formed in line of battle by the
maneuver, "By the right flank into line." The
woods were thick with much undergrowth, and we
could see only a few yards in front.</p>

<p class='c000'>For some time after the line was formed, everything
was quiet. It was a cloudy, misty morning,
and the air was filled with the smoke of the recent
firing; no enemy was in sight nor could we see
any of the Confederates who had been engaged. It
has always been a mystery to me what became of
these troops. We could see and smell the smoke
from their guns, but not a man was seen, except
perhaps fifteen or twenty who came out as we
entered.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Company C was on the left of the Eleventh Regiment,
and the Seventh Regiment, commanded by
Col. James L. Kemper, was the next regiment on
the left. Colonel Kemper took position at the right
of his regiment. My place, as first lieutenant of
Company C, being near the left of the company,
placed me close to Colonel Kemper, and it is of the
fighting along the line of these two regiments I
propose to tell, as I saw and heard it that day.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>"GIVE IT TO THEM!"</h3>

<p class='c008'>While standing here in line of battle some of
Company C saw a line of men through a slight
opening in the woods about one hundred yards away,
obliquely to the left. Only a few files of the men
were visible through the vista; some one called my
attention to these men. I looked; they seemed to have
on blue uniforms, and the brass buttons on their
coats could be plainly seen; they were standing at
rest. I called Colonel Kemper, who came and said
he believed they were Yankees, but was not certain.
Just then General Hill, on foot, came along down in
the rear of the line of battle from the right, and
Colonel Kemper called his attention to these men.
General Hill leveled his field-glasses on the line, and
in a moment said: "Yes, they are Yankees; give
it to them!" Colonel Kemper's clear-ringing voice
broke the stillness with, "Now, boys, I want you to
give it to those blue-coated fellows; ready, aim,
fire." At the first command every musket was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>raised to the shoulder and leveled, every eye ran
along the barrel at the command "aim," and at the
word "fire" a sheet of flame burst forth from the
line with a deafening roar.</p>

<p class='c000'>Very few of our men could see the enemy, but
every man shot straight to the front—the guns on a
level. No doubt, the first volley did much execution,
the men reloading as quickly as possible and continuing
to fire rapidly. In the midst of the firing
Colonel Kemper's clarion voice rang out above the
roar of the muskets. He said: "General Hill says
the line must be advanced." Not a man moved forward,
but all continued loading and shooting as fast
possible. Again Colonel Kemper shouted louder
than before: "General Hill says the lines must be
advanced." At this moment General Hill came to
the front, immediately in front of Company C,
pistol in hand. General Hill wore a dark blue
blouse or overshirt, gathered at the waist by the
sword belt, had on a military cap with a sprig of
pine fastened in front, and as he went forward,
waving his pistol over his head, looking back over
his shoulder and calling on the men to follow, made
a splendid picture of the heroic and gallant soldier
that he was. This picture was photographed on my
memory never to be forgotten.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>INTO A HOT FIRE</h3>

<p class='c008'>The whole line rushed forward over a fence
and down a slight slope in the ground, about fifty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>yards, and was met by a close and deadly fire from
the enemy, whom we could not see, but the sharp,
quick "sip, sip" of the minie balls, as they whacked
the trees and cut the bushes and twigs, told plainly
that we were in very close quarters. On the hill
where the firing commenced, I don't remember that
we suffered any casualties—I think the Yankees shot
too low; but now the men were falling on every
hand. The firing was kept up here for some little
time, the men sitting or kneeling on the ground,
loading and shooting into the bushes in front whence
the balls were coming, though no enemy was in
sight. While here I looked to the left, oblique from
our front, and saw a Yankee standing beside a tree
some seventy-five yards away, about where the line
had been first seen. Up to this time I had carried
a pistol, a Colt's five-shooter, and drawing this I
aimed at this Yankee, snapped the pistol several
times, which, failing to fire, I threw it down, picked
up a loaded musket that had fallen from the hands
of some man, killed or wounded, and fired at the
Yankee; where he was hit, I never knew. About
this time the cry came along our lines from the
right, "They are running." The line again pushed
forward, but we did not catch sight of the Yankees,
that is, live ones, but a short distance, some twenty
yards in front, their line of battle was plainly
marked by the dead men lying strewn along through
the woods. The lines continued to press forward
through the woods for a quarter of a mile or more,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>until the eastern edge of the woods was reached,
where the timber had been felled.</p>

<p class='c000'>While pushing along through the woods I saw to
my left several of Company C around a gray-haired
Yankee officer with side-whiskers and mustache,
seemingly rifling his pockets. I shouted at the men,
"Stop robbing that officer." They replied, "We are
just loosening his belt." The officer said the same
when I approached him. He had been desperately
wounded and left by his men.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the felled timber, some thirty yards from the
woods, the Yankees had taken refuge, lying down
behind the logs and stumps, and as the Confederates
came up, opened a close and rapid fire, our
men protecting themselves behind trees and logs at
the edge of the woods and returning the fire. Here
the firing was fast and furious, both sides being
under cover. The casualties here were not serious,
on the Confederate side, at least, the Yankees shooting
too high, riddling the trees and bushes overhead.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>COLONEL GARLAND WOUNDED</h3>

<p class='c008'>In the midst of this severe fighting, Colonel Garland,
with his left arm bandaged and in a sling, came
up. He had been shot through the forearm early in
the action, had his wound dressed, and continued
in the fight to the end.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as Colonel Garland came up, he shouted
out, "Charge 'em!" Captain Clement, a brave man,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>whose courage was beyond question and who still
lives in Campbell County, a scarred veteran, remonstrated,
saying: "For God's sake, Colonel Garland,
don't send the men over there into that fire. They
will all be killed." Colonel Garland replied: "Well,
hold on a while then." It was not long before the
fire of the enemy began to slacken—the well-aimed
shots of the Confederates were telling. Our
lines rose up without orders, and over the logs the
men rushed right among the Yankees. Some of the
enemy jumped up and ran; many were shot down as
they ran; others lay still behind the logs and stumps
and were captured; some were hauled from brush
piles, and many lay killed and wounded on the
ground, most of whom were shot in the head. This
scene reminded me of a lot of boys hunting rabbits
in thickets.</p>

<p class='c000'>While engaged in gathering up the prisoners,
sending them to the rear and exulting over the
victory, the noise of artillery wheels was heard (it
was impossible to see far, on account of the smoke
and fog), and the men were ordered back to the
woods whence they had just charged. There were
several abandoned Yankee cannon in the road in our
front; I don't remember whether these were taken
off the field or not, but think they were. We held this
position during the remainder of the day, without
seeing or hearing anything of the enemy in our
front.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Pretty soon after we fell back to the edge of the
woods, a terrific musketry fire opened up to the right
of this position, which seemed to be a little to the
rear of the extension of the line, the minie balls flying
thick and fast through the woods in the rear. As
this firing increased in volume and seemed to be
drawing nearer, some of the Seventh Regiment
began to look anxiously to the rear, like a balky
horse, as if contemplating a retreat. All eyes were
turned in the direction of the firing, which was only
a few hundred yards to the right, and seemed to be
drawing closer. Colonel Kemper, who was still at
the right of the Seventh, noticed the anxiety of his
men, and spoke out in firm and defiant tones:
"Steady, men, steady. The old Eighth Virginia is
out there." I never knew whether or not the Eighth
Regiment was out there—I don't think it was; but
Kemper's words had the desired effect.</p>

<p class='c000'>The men remembered Ball's Bluff, where the
Eighth Virginia had some time before distinguished
itself, and whatever fears they may have had of
being flanked were allayed, and every man stood
firmly at his post.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not long until the firing ceased all along
the lines. The brigade remained here until darkness
closed over the bloody scenes and thrilling
events of the day, which were, no doubt, indelibly
fixed in the minds of every participant.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the meanwhile, the battle was raging to the
left over towards Fort McGruder, where the fighting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>first commenced in the morning, and was kept
up pretty much all day. Here the Twenty-fourth
Virginia and the Fifth North Carolina distinguished
themselves, as Pickett's Division did at Gettysburg,
in an unsuccessful, but gallant charge. There were
no better fighting regiments in the army.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon after dark the brigade moved silently off
by the left flank, marching back to the edge of
Williamsburg, where we had turned off the road
early in the morning. We slept on the wet, muddy
ground until daybreak next morning, when we again
marched through the old town towards Richmond,
the men gathering up their knapsacks deposited
along the street in the front yards the day before,
and which the people had taken care of.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the march we did not hurry, camping four or
five days on the east bank of the Chickahominy;
but the enemy did not crowd us again, the work of
the 5th of May having taught General McClellan a
lesson, the moral of which was, "Don't crowd Joe
Johnston too closely on a retreat." Some of the
Yankee historians claim a victory at Williamsburg,
a dear-bought victory to be sure. They lost about
five hundred killed, fifteen hundred wounded, and
four hundred unwounded prisoners, twelve cannon,
and ten stand of colors.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Confederate loss was much less. We drove
the enemy back, held the battlefield, and marched
off the next morning at our leisure, and did not
have a chance to fire another shot at the Yankees for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>weeks; indeed, not until the 31st day of May, when
Johnston again attacked and defeated them at Seven
Pines. We had whipped them in a fair, stand-up
fight with muskets at Williamsburg. It is a little
singular and surprising that McClellan with his
"grand army" never made an attack on the Confederates,
but on the contrary, was always on the
defensive in all the battles from Williamsburg to
Malvern Hill.</p>

<p class='c000'>I saw nothing of the fighting on the 5th of May
on the left of the lines, nor on the right, except
along the lines of the Seventh and Eleventh Regiments.
I know full well we cleaned them up here
in nice style, with small loss, comparatively. We
drove them from their first line in the woods,
charged and captured their second position in the
fallen timber, killing, wounding, capturing and
scattering everything in front of Hill's Brigade. If
this was not a victory, I'd like to know what it was.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was the first regular fight in which the
Eleventh Regiment had been engaged. The regiment,
except two companies, was only under fire on the
18th of July at Blackburn's Ford, but did not fire a
gun. On the 21st of July the regiment lay all day
under a shelling, but did not see a Yankee or fire a
gun. In the skirmish at Drainesville, in which Company
C lost its first man, I am not certain, but I
don't think there was much shooting done by the
regiment.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>At Williamsburg we got into it right. Company
C lost eight men killed and many wounded. The
killed were Miffram Bailey, who married my wife's
sister, and had only been with the company about a
month; Benj. Farris, Crockett Hughes, Granville
Rosser, David Layne, John Organ, John J. Wood,
another recruit, and Wm. H. Wilson, a first cousin
of my wife, all of whom were good soldiers. I
noticed Billy Wilson, during the fight in the bottom,
some distance in front of the line, fighting with
deadly intent. I have often thought that he determined
to distinguish himself in this fight, but alas!
he was stricken down, shot through the body, dying
in a few minutes. In this fight, so far as I could see,
every officer and man, from General Hill down to
the humblest private, did his whole duty. I never
saw troops fight better on any field.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>INCIDENTS OF THE BATTLE</h3>

<p class='c008'>I have often said this was the most satisfactory
fight I was ever engaged in, and I have read somewhere
that General Kemper had said the same
thing. I noticed among others a member of Company
C, Jim Brown, from "Hell Bend" (a rather
disreputable section of Campbell County), an humble
private of no pretentions, standing up and fighting
like mad, loading and shooting rapidly, with the
corners of his mouth blacked by the powder as he
bit off the cartridges. I never forgot this, and it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>stood Jim in good stead when, months afterwards,
he was court-martialed for absence without leave,
and sentenced to wear a ball and chain for sixty
days. At Goldsboro, N. C., in 1863, when Chas.
Clement drew up a petition for his pardon, I gladly
approved it, making an endorsement on the petition
to the effect, that "Brown was a brave soldier, had
been tried in battle and found not wanting in
courage, fighting like a hero." The paper was forwarded
to headquarters, and quickly came back
with an endorsement granting the pardon prayed
for. I remember it was at night when it was
returned to me. I at once repaired to Brown's
quarters, and found him and several others in their
"dog house," under their blankets, with the ball and
chain at the foot, lying on the ground. I called to
Brown, telling him his pardon had come, that he
could now take off the ball and chain. Brown
raised up on his elbow, looked down at the ball and
chain and said: "I have gone to bed now; I believe
I will wait till morning before I take it off." And
so he did. Brown remained true to the end, and
was captured at Milford, May 21, 1864.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the firing had all ceased, Colonel Kemper
and Colonel Garland met on the lines in the rear
of Company C and exchanged congratulations, both
in high spirits and well pleased with the day's work.
Colonel Garland said among other things, "Kemper,
honor's easy with you to-day." I was standing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>near, and pointing to Garland's bandaged arm in
the sling, said: "Colonel Garland, you have the
best of it, you have a wound." "Yes," replied
Garland, "I always wanted an honorable wound in
this war." Poor fellow, he got his death-wound at
Boonsboro Gap, Md., a few months afterwards
while trying to rally his brigade. Colonel Garland
was a fine soldier, and if he had lived, would doubtless
have attained higher rank. He had a worthy
ambition, was cool and steady in action, not
possessed so much of that brute courage that makes
men reckless in battle, but in an eminent degree of
that high moral courage and pride that enable true
soldiers to do their duty in the face of the greatest
danger. He was highly endowed intellectually, a
learned lawyer, a brilliant and eloquent speaker, and
possessed of considerable wealth. Colonel Garland
had a bright future before him, but alas! like so
many others, was cut down in his early manhood, in
that cruel and ruthless war waged by the North
against the South.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>GARLAND AND KEMPER PROMOTED</h3>

<p class='c008'>Garland and Kemper both won the stars and
wreath of a brigadier at Williamsburg. The former
was first promoted and assigned to a North Carolina
Brigade, the latter soon afterwards succeeding
Gen. A. P. Hill as commander of the First Brigade,
which he led into battle the first time at Seven
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Pines, in less than one month after the Williamsburg
fight.</p>

<p class='c000'>I remember, when Colonel Kemper took command
of the brigade, he had his old regiment, the Seventh
Virginia, formed, and, mounted on his horse in
front of the regiment, made a stirring and patriotic
speech, eulogizing the men for their courage and
devotion to the cause, and expressing his love and
devotion to all of them, declaring that, "Next to
the child that sprang from my own loins, I love the
Seventh Regiment."</p>

<p class='c000'>Before closing the account of this battle, I will
relate one of the many incidents of cool and deliberate
bravery exhibited by the Confederate soldiers
on that day. While the firing at the edge of the
woods was going on, Daniel Pillow, a private of
Company C, Eleventh Virginia, when ready to fire,
would raise up on his knees as high as he could, look
intently out among the logs and stumps in front,
then raise his gun, take deliberate aim and fire, and
after firing raise his head again and look in the
direction he had shot. I called to him, saying,
"Daniel, when you have fired, don't expose yourself
in that way by looking over there; get down and
load as quickly as possible." Pillow turned his face
towards me and said quietly in measured tones, "I
reckon I want to see what I am doing," and continued
firing.</p>

<p class='c000'>I also noticed Robt. Cocke, pressing forward in
the hottest of the fight in the attitude of one breasting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>a storm, leaning forward with a determined expression
on his face; in fact, I did not see a single
man of the company flinch.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Clement wrote home highly complimenting
the men and officers of his company for their
conduct in this fight.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>As before said, on the 6th of May we again
marched through Williamsburg on towards Richmond.
The roads were deep in mud; it was a hot,
sultry May morning. A few miles out on the road I
was taken suddenly very sick, and lay down on the
roadside utterly unable to march any further.
Visions of capture and prison rose before me like
a nightmare. The regimental ambulance was in
the rear, and when it came up I was taken in and
rode all day, camping that night with the wagon
trains, and the next day rejoined the command.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 9th of May we reached the Chickahominy
River at Bottom's Bridge, where we remained for
several days, waiting for the Yankees, but they did
not come so fast as they did at Williamsburg. On
the first day's march from here it was raining, the
marching being very fatiguing. I remember that
night when we turned off the road into woods
partially cleared with the brush piled, I spread my
blanket on one of the piles of brush, with a Yankee
oilcloth over me, and slept soundly till morning. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>rained nearly all night, but I was dry and ready for
the march the next morning. The next day we
trudged on up the Peninsula, passing by some
historic old homesteads, among others, if I remember
aright, Ex-President John Tyler's old place and
his grave (the tombstone a simple white slab) by the
roadside.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 15th of May the brigade went into camp
in the vicinity of Richmond, near what was called
Darbytown (though I don't remember seeing anything
like a town or village), where it remained for
a few days. This locality, I later learned, is called
Darbytown after a family of Enroughties, whose
local cognomen is Darby. How Darby could have
been evolved out of Enroughty has always been, to
me, one of the mysteries of evolution. Yet quite as
reasonable as that man sprang from a monkey. I
got a pass from here into Richmond, where I bought
an officer's uniform, having before only a jacket.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 27th of May we moved to a camp near
Howard's Grove, remaining there only four days,
when the battle of Seven Pines came off.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE BATTLE OF SEVEN PINES</h3>

<p class='c008'>Early on the morning of the 31st of May, 1862,
the brigade marched out of camp to go into the
battle of Seven Pines. Orders were issued the night
before to take every available man, even the cooks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every one knew that a battle was to be fought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>that day. I remember as we marched along the
road that morning, it somehow occurred to me that
I would be wounded in this battle. Dr. Thornhill
was passing along and I remarked to him that I
felt I would be wounded, and that he must see
after me. The doctor replied, "Oh, you must not
think that." W. T. Withers, of Company C, who
had been detailed as hospital steward, also came
along and remarked that I had a chance to win my
spurs that day, I having a short time before taken
command of Company C. Captain Clement promoted
to major, had gone home for his horse and
equipments.</p>

<p class='c000'>I didn't get wounded that day nor win any spurs
that I ever saw, but was in a very hot fight, and had
three bullet holes through my clothes. So my
presentment came near being thrice fulfilled.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two corps of the Yankee army had crossed over
the Chickahominy at Bottom's Bridge, fortifying
their position at Fair Oaks and Seven Pines, near
Richmond, while three corps remained on the other
side of the river. General Johnston and his generals
had conceived the plan of falling suddenly on these
two corps and crushing them before relief could
reach them from the other side. It was said General
Longstreet first made the suggestion. The night
before, it had rained very hard; this it was thought
would add to the success of the scheme, as the rain
would raise the Chickahominy and keep back reënforcements,
but the swollen streams and muddy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>roads delayed the movements of the Confederate
troops, so that the attack upon the enemy's lines was
delayed until three o'clock <span class='fss'>P. M.</span>, while the plan was
for it to be made in the morning by nine or ten
o'clock.</p>

<p class='c000'>Longstreet with his own and D. H. Hill's Division
was to make the attack at Seven Pines, and was
ready early in the morning, but other troops who
were to assist on other portions of the line failed
to come up and take position until three o'clock <span class='fss'>P. M.</span>
This no doubt caused a partial failure of the enterprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>While the Yankees were soundly thrashed and
driven from their breastworks and camps, yet they
were not crushed and captured, as it was hoped they
would be.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gen. Jas. L. Kemper was now in command of the
brigade, which, as before said, was first commanded
by Longstreet, and then by A. P. Hill, who was now
a major-general. The brigade was held in reserve
while the other brigades of Longstreet's and D. H.
Hill's divisions advanced on the Yankee lines, who
were in their fortified camps at Seven Pines.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE BRIGADE IN RESERVE</h3>

<p class='c008'>It is one of the rules of war to hold the best
troops in reserve, and put them into the fight at the
critical moment. No brigade in the army stood
higher than the "First Virginia," as it was called.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>The Eleventh Regiment, which stood as high as the
highest, was in reserve at the battle of July 18, 1861,
at Blackburn's Ford. The brigade was in reserve at
Williamsburg on the 5th of May, and now again
at Seven Pines on the 30th of May, and also soon
afterwards at Gaines' Mill on the 27th of June, and
in many other battles during the war.</p>

<p class='c000'>The brigade was posted in an open field about
three-fourths of a mile from the Yankee lines, the
enemy's first line being in the woods at the edge of
a field, the woods extending to within two hundred
yards of the Yankee camps, and in front of the camp
were breastworks and redoubts mounted with big
guns. The attacking Confederate troops were in
these woods also. The brigade was first marched
off the road some distance to the right, then marched
back, the left resting on the road leading down to
Seven Pines, where it remained standing in line
until ordered into the fight. While here the firing
commenced in the woods at the front. About this
time the command was given to load. The ramrods
rattling down the musket barrels created a sensation
akin to that of the clods falling upon the coffin
lid, which is a reminder that some one is dead,
and suggested the question, Who will be the next?
The first suggested death to many, and who will
be the victims? While loading, I spoke a few words
to the men of the company, exhorting them to do
their duty, and remember what they were fighting
for.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>The fighting was very heavy in front for some
time, and we expecting every moment to be called
into action. Such suspense is very trying, but not
as bad as lying under a shelling.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>INTO THE FIGHT AT DOUBLE-QUICK</h3>

<p class='c008'>General Longstreet, with his staff about him, was
sitting on his horse in the road close by, looking
intently in the direction of the firing. I don't
remember how long after the firing began, half an
hour or perhaps more (time seems to move slow on
such occasions), it was not long, however, before
the brigade was ordered to go to the front in double-quick
time, and down the road we went in a run.
About the time the woods were reached, the wounded
men began to appear in large numbers going to the
rear, some on foot, some on stretchers, and some
in ambulances; some limping along, shot in their
feet or legs; some holding a wounded hand or arm;
all bleeding and bedraggled, having charged through
a swamp; some groaning and moaning, lamenting
their sad fate, in utter despair and helplessness;
others, in grim and heroic silence, bearing the pain
and shock of their wounds in silence, with fortitude
and bravery.</p>

<p class='c000'>One man I remember, who was completely demoralized,
called out as we passed him, making his
way to the rear, "Oh, men," he wailed, "don't go
down there, you will all be killed; they are killing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>our men, they have wounded me. It is no use to
go; don't go." A little further on, came another
man, shot in the head or face, bleeding profusely,
bareheaded, swinging his arms and shouting at the
top of his voice, "Go in, boys, and give 'em hell.
They have shot me, but I gave them the devil first;
go in, boys, and give it to 'em." These two incidents
illustrate how some men are affected in battle. The
one was completely undone, perhaps he had no relish
for the fight in the start, and was probably what
was called in the army, "a whiner"; always low
spirited and complaining of everything that happened.
The other brave and resolute, who took
things as they came, making the best of everything.
Of such were a large majority of Confederate soldiers—this
last class.</p>

<p class='c000'>On, the brigade went still at a run, the Eleventh
Regiment leading, Company C in front. Capt.
J. Lawrence Meem, of Lynchburg, who, until Garland's
promotion was adjutant of the Eleventh
Regiment, and was now General Garland's chief of
staff, met us with word from the front to "hurry."
By this time all were well out of breath, but rushed
on at increased speed through mud and water almost
knee-deep in some places. Again a messenger is sent
from Gen. D. H. Hill to "hurry, it is a critical
time at the front; the enemy has been driven from
his breastworks and camps, but there are not enough
men of the assaulting column left to occupy and
hold the works. The men are doing all that mortal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>men can do, some are falling by the wayside from
sheer exhaustion, nothing but the excitement keeps
any on their feet." General Kemper said to the
messenger, "Tell General Hill I am left in front
and would like to change." The messenger replied,
"No time to change now, hurry on." Soon the
brigade emerged from the woods into the open field,
on the farther side of which the Yankee breastworks
and camps were located, but not a living soldier,
Yankee or Confederate, was in sight. I have said
"living soldier," because as we rushed along by the
edge of this field, over which the Confederates had
charged, the ground was thickly strewn with dead
Confederates close up to the Yankee breastworks
and redoubts, where stood their abandoned cannon.
Passing beyond these works, Generals Hill and
Garland, with their staff officers, were seen waiting,
behind a big pile of cord wood, the coming of the
brigade, which was directed to file to the right
through the Yankee camp, with their small fly-tents
still standing, where, facing towards the enemy, the
rear rank was in front, but this made little or no
difference. Like the English "Fore and Aft," the
men fight from front or rear rank just the same. As
the brigade filed out through the camp, a terrific fire
was opened by the Yankees, who had rallied or been
reënforced by fresh troops, a hundred or two yards
beyond their camp. The Yankee lines could not be
seen on account of the smoke and fog, but the balls
flew thick through the air, killing and wounding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>many. The men lying flat on the ground, returned
the fire as best they could. In a short time some one
gave the order to fall back to the abandoned Yankee
breastworks, some forty or fifty yards in the rear,
which afforded protection from the enemy's shots.
This order was obeyed in double-quick time, all
hurrying over the breastworks, getting on the reverse
side, into the ditch half filled with water, preferring
the cold water to hot lead. I did not hear the order
to fall back, and the others got the start of me. I
think I was the last man to go over the works, and
was sure a Yankee bullet would hit me as I did so.
I expect it was here that one or more of the bullets
passed through my clothes. I thought about being
shot in the back, of which I always had a dread, but
did not take time to turn around, face the enemy
and go over backwards, making all haste possible
to get out of danger. From the breastworks the
fire was kept up for some time, until General Kemper
sent a detachment around on the enemy's left flank,
when the firing ceased.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>INCIDENTS OF THE BATTLE</h3>

<p class='c008'>The brigade lost a good many men in this fight,
Colonel Funston and Lieutenant-Colonel Langhorne,
of the Eleventh Regiment both being badly wounded
and permanently disabled. Company C lost three
men killed, namely: James Wood, Silas Barber, and
James Terrell, all recruits, and several wounded.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Terrell was in the Mexican War. Capt. Lawrence
Meem, Garland's chief of staff, was killed dead on
the field, shot through the head; a fine soldier he
was too, brave, handsome and accomplished. Capt.
Henry Fulks, of Company F, was killed in a few
feet of me. He had rushed into the Yankee camp
exhausted from the double-quicking, sat down on
a Yankee fly-tent, which sank to the ground with his
weight, and had just raised his head to look to the
front when a ball struck him about the head or face,
when he sank back and was dead in a few minutes.
I heard the whack of the ball as it struck him and
saw the blood trickling down his neck. About this
time Color-Bearer Hickok, of the Eleventh Regiment,
who was standing close by with his flag in
hand, and who was about the only man or officer I
saw on his feet, was shot down, badly wounded,
when Color-Guard Jim Haynes, of Company F,
seized the colors and rushed to Captain Foulks, taking
him in his arms, but still holding the flag aloft,
and cried out, "Oh, my poor captain is killed; my
poor captain is killed." So Captain Foulks died with
the Confederate battle-flag waving over him, its
folds partly enveloping his body.</p>

<p class='c000'>I must again refer to Daniel Pillow, of Company
C, who was so cool and deliberate and fought with
such deadly intent at Williamsburg. When the
troops fell back to the breastworks, Pillow, instead
of getting down in the ditch as the others did, took
his seat on the parapet while several comrades
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>behind him loaded guns which he fired at the enemy
with deliberate aim. At one time the order was
given to cease firing; it was thought some Confederates
were in front between the lines. Pillow paid
no heed to the order. Colonel Corse, of the Seventeenth
Regiment, came along the lines, and said to
Pillow, "My man, cease firing, our men are over
there." Pillow turned towards the Colonel and
said with determination and sternness: "Don't I
see the Stars and Stripes? I am going to shoot";
and continued firing as before. Colonel Corse stooping
down, looked under the smoke and fog, and seeing
the Yankee flag, said, "Well, fire away then."</p>

<p class='c000'>Daniel Pillow was an humble private, an "overseer"
at the beginning of the war, without education
or pretensions, but he was a soldier, every inch of
him. He was always at his post, ever ready for any
duty. Being six feet or more tall, he marched at the
head of the company, being always near me on the
march and in battle; never grumbled or whined,
and was one of the bravest of the brave. He was
reported missing at Gettysburg, and never heard of
again. I have no doubt that he fell with his face
to the foe in that desperate charge in which Pickett's
Division was immortalized, and that he sleeps in an
unknown soldier's grave. All honor to his memory.</p>

<p class='c000'>Walter Rosser, Jim Cocke, Sam Franklin, and
Daniel Pillow were the big, or rather the tall, four
of Company C, being over six feet high; were
always at the head of the company, and all good
fighters, too.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>There was no more fighting on this part of the
line. The Confederates had driven the Yankees
from their works and camp, capturing all their
camp equipage and stores, several pieces of cannon,
7,000 muskets, and about 350 prisoners. Longstreet's
and D. H. Hill's divisions had soundly
thrashed a Yankee corps under General Keys.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gen. G. W. Smith was on the Confederate left
towards Fair Oaks station, but was not engaged
until nearly night, when General Sumner's Corps,
crossing over the Chickahominy, came to the relief
of Hientzleman and Kasey, whose troops fell back in
that direction and were joined by Sumner in resisting
Smith's attack. General Johnston, who was on
this part of the line, was wounded about seven
o'clock, when the command devolved on General
Smith.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wounding of the Confederate commander-in-chief
at this critical moment was a great misfortune
to the Confederates, and no doubt lessened their
chances of the complete success aimed at—the
destruction and capture of the two corps that had
crossed over the Chickahominy.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the number of troops engaged, this was one
of the bloodiest battles of the war. The Confederate
loss both days was estimated at a little over 6,000
killed and wounded; the Yankee loss a little over
5,000. The Confederates attacked the enemy in his
breastworks, which accounts for the heavy loss sustained.
The Confederates also captured many
prisoners and several pieces of cannon.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>The brigade remained behind the breastworks
until after dark, then other troops took its place,
when we marched back a short distance and slept
under some scrub-oak trees. I remember that night
a young kinsman of mine, George Bright, from
Prince Edward County, who was acting as courier
for General Kemper, came to where we were to enquire
how we fared in the fight, and gave me a first-rate
new blanket he had picked up in the Yankee
camp, which I carried and used through the rest of
the war, only parting with it when I left Fort Delaware,
in May, 1865. I remember also that Dr. Thornhill
got General Kasey's large camp-chair, with the
General's name on it, which the doctor used as long
as he remained in the field.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next morning, which was Sunday, the brigade
marched back to the breastworks, formed in line of
battle at right angles with the works, facing towards
Fair Oaks, where it remained during the day, lying
in the hot (first day of June) sun, without any protection
from its rays, all day long. There was considerable
fighting towards Fair Oaks early that Sunday
morning, but none on this immediate line.</p>

<p class='c000'>That night the Confederates marched out from
the lines back towards Richmond, Kemper's
Brigade, as it was now called, going into camp just
northeast of Richmond, where it remained until the
26th of June, 1862, when the Seven Days' battles
around Richmond began.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>ON THE PICKET LINES</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>After the battle of Seven Pines, picket duty was
very heavy—whole regiments going on duty, some
on the advance line and others in reserve. The
Eleventh Regiment picketed near Seven Pines. The
advance lines or posts were in the woods, near where
the fighting commenced on the 31st of May, and
very close to the Yankees.</p>

<p class='c000'>I remember one morning, when the Eleventh
Regiment was ordered on picket, while getting ready
to go, I heard one of the men say, "I understand
picket firing <em>are</em> very fatal down there." The
pickets would fire on each other at every opportunity.</p>

<p class='c000'>On this trip the Eleventh Regiment was in
reserve, while some North Carolina troops occupied
the advanced posts. During the time a North
Carolina captain came running back from the front
where there was some sharp firing, and reported
that the Yankees had charged the picket lines,
capturing and killing all of his company—he alone
being left to tell the tale.</p>

<p class='c000'>Company C and Company H were ordered from
the reserves to go to the front and retake the picket
lines. Accordingly the two companies were formed
in line of battle in the open field, a few hundred
yards from the woods, Captain Hutter, of Company
H, being the senior officer, commanding. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>marched on towards the woods, expecting every
moment to be fired upon, Captain Hutter leading in
front of the line.</p>

<p class='c000'>The woods were reached without seeing or hearing
of the enemy. Advancing into the woods some
distance, the Confederate pickets were discovered
at their posts on the alert, watching for the Yankee
pickets through the bushes. They motioned to us
and spoke in low tones, warning us to keep under
cover, that the Yankees would fire on sight of any
one. So it turned out that the pickets had not been
killed or captured, the Tar Heel captain being the
only man who had been demoralized and run away.</p>

<p class='c000'>I walked out into the road running through the
woods along which we had gone into the fight on
the 31st of May, and as I did so, one of the pickets
close by waved me back, saying: "Don't go out
there, you will be shot." I remained long enough
in the road to see, a few hundred yards away, at the
farther edge of the woods, a column of blue-coated
Yankees passing across the road, moving to the
right, with the Stars and Stripes—a very large flag—flying
above them. That flag looked hateful to
me then, and on other occasions, when I saw it
flying above the heads of men with guns in their
hands, who were our deadly enemies, invaders of
the sacred soil of Virginia, doing their utmost to
kill her sons who dared to defend their rights, and
who burned houses and devastated the country ruthlessly
and cruelly; and now I here record, that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>have never since that day looked very <em>admiringly</em>
or <em>adoringly</em> on that flag, nor have I since the war
worn any blue clothes.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a short time I went back to the general commanding
the picket lines and reported that the
pickets were on their posts, with the line intact,
also that I had seen the column moving to the right.
The general remarked, "They are massing on our
right," and ordered a battery to open fire in that
direction. This fire drew no response from the
enemy, and in a short time the two companies were
ordered back to the reserves, and all was quiet.</p>

<p class='c000'>As I was going back to report to the general I
met the Tar Heel captain, a small, pale-faced youth.
He seemed much relieved when I informed him that
his company was not captured, and hastened down
to rejoin them, saying, "That's all right," mortified,
no doubt, that he ran away. I felt sorry for him.</p>

  <h2 id='CHAPTER_IX' class='c004'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br /> <span class='sc'>Seven Days' Fight Around Richmond—Battle<br /> of Gaines' Mill</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The brigade remained near Richmond some
weeks longer. On the afternoon of the 26th of
June, 1862, the Seven Days' fights around Richmond
commenced at, or near, Mechanicsville, north
of Richmond on the upper Chickahominy. McClellan's
army lay on both sides of the Chickahominy,
his right wing extending as far up the
stream as Mechanicsville.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gen. R. E. Lee was now in command of the army
around Richmond, and determined to strike a blow
at the enemy instead of waiting to be attacked at
Richmond. On the morning of the 26th of June
we marched out of camp, going north. As we crossed
the York River Railroad an engine, with an inflated
balloon attached to a heavy cable, passed along.
This balloon was used by the Confederates in
observing the movements of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c000'>By a master stroke of strategy Stonewall Jackson
was brought from the Valley, where he had just
out-generaled and whipped three Yankee armies in
detail, each larger than his own, and before any of
the Yankee generals anywhere knew of his movements,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>joined General Lee and helped thrash McClellan
and his "grand army," now 160,000 strong;
Lee had about 80,000 all told.</p>

<p class='c000'>A. P. Hill's division crossed the upper Chickahominy
on the 26th of June, and in the afternoon
attacked the Yankees in a strong position on Beaver
Dam Creek, driving them from their first lines. It
was expected that Jackson's forces would join with
A. P. Hill's in this attack by striking the enemy on
the right flank and rear, but from some unknown
cause, Jackson's men were delayed, and did not
arrive in time. The battle lasted until nightfall.
The Confederates lost heavily in this fight, from
assaults on the enemy's works.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Yankees withdrew from their position during
the night and fell back to Gaines' Mill, lower
down the Chickahominy, where the next day a
terrific and bloody battle was fought and won by
the Confederates.</p>

<p class='c000'>Longstreet's Division crossed over the Chickahominy
at Meadow Bridge, below where Hill had
crossed the day before, and moved down towards
Gaines' Mill, as the right wing of Lee's army, on the
north side of the Chickahominy, with Hill in the
center and Jackson on the left. Kemper's Brigade
halted as it was crossing the bridge, with the Eleventh
Regiment, or a part of it, on the bridge. While
waiting here, General Lee rode by on "Traveler,"
picking his way carefully along through the ranks.
When close to Company C, General Lee asked what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>regiment this was. Perhaps a dozen men spoke out,
saying, "Eleventh Virginia."</p>

<p class='c000'>Up to this time, the 27th of June, no one but the
generals knew that Jackson was anywhere near.
During the day it was rumored that Jackson had
come from the Valley or was coming. That afternoon
I saw some men from Campbell County who
belonged to Jackson's army, and asked them if it
were true that Jackson was near. They replied,
"Yes, Jackson and all his men are right over there,"
pointing to the left. This was, indeed, good news.
This piece of strategy had been worked to perfection
by General Lee. I remember a few days before, it
was reported, in fact well known, that Lee was
sending reënforcements to Jackson in the Valley.
General Whiting's Division was sent by train via
Lynchburg, around-about way—no doubt to attract
attention and deceive the enemy—to Staunton,
where it remained until the proper time, when it
came back with Jackson's troops via Charlottesville
and Gordonsville.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>BATTLE OF GAINES' MILL</h3>

<p class='c008'>At this battle of Gaines' Mill, on the 27th of
June, 1862, Kemper's Brigade was again in reserve,
and was not actually engaged in the fight, the
Yankees breaking just as it was called in to reënforce
after sundown. This was one day the sun
set before we got into the fight.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>The brigade lay back in the pine woods, where
now and then a stray shell would come, anxiously
awaiting the issue of the battle at the front—not
"eager for the fight," but ready to go when called
on. It was about sunset when Capt. J. W. Fairfax,
of General Longstreet's staff, on his war horse, came
bounding over the logs and brush, through the
woods, towards where the brigade lay. All knew then
what was up; the men knew they were wanted
whenever Captain Fairfax was seen dashing up on
his gray charger in time of a fight. Then some one
was sure to say, "Boys, we've got to go in now;
yonder comes Captain Fairfax after us." Longstreet
with the rest of his division was hotly engaged
at the front.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was one of the hardest fought battles of the
war. We lay in full hearing, though not in sight of
the battle-ground, on account of the woods and hills
intervening. I never before or afterwards heard
such heavy musketry firing. I have read somewhere
that General Lee said it was the heaviest he
ever heard.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Confederates lost heavily in this fight, as
they attacked the enemy in strong, fortified positions.
The Yankees admitted a loss of 9,000 killed
and wounded, and twenty-two cannon.</p>

<p class='c000'>The brigade went down the road towards the
battlefield. It was nearly dark by the time we got
down to the creek, when the firing ceased, and the
battle was over. The Yankees had been driven from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>every part of the field, and that night crossed to the
south side of the Chickahominy, and McClellan
commenced his retreat by the left flank to James
River.</p>

<p class='c000'>I remember, as we were going down the road,
seeing Chaplain John C. Granberry, later Bishop
Granberry, going along with the men. I said to
him, "Mr. Granberry, you ought not to go into this
fight; you have no gun and may get shot." He
replied, "I have an object in going," and on he
went. A few days afterwards, at Malvern Hill, he
was badly wounded and left on the field for dead,
but recovered, losing the sight of an eye, however,
from the effects of a wound on the brow. I
remember also, as we were going down the hill, we
heard that Col. R. E. Withers had been mortally
wounded. As we crossed the bridge over Powhite
Creek I saw the surgeon of the Eighteenth Virginia,
which the Colonel commanded, and asked the
doctor if Colonel Withers was badly wounded.
"Yes, sir," he replied, "he can not live an hour."
He did live, however.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was sick that day, but stayed with the company
until the fighting was all over, when I started back
to Richmond, the surgeon having given me a sick-pass
during the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c000'>I determined, however, to go into the fight if the
regiment was called on, but as before said, the
Yankees gave it up before we got at them, to which
I had not the slightest objection; in fact, I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>very glad of it. I made my way back towards
Richmond next day, walking very slowly, and resting
often by the wayside, went to the camp where
the tents were still standing, where the man Pillow
I have spoken of was also sick. In a few days
several old men from Campbell County, who had
come to Richmond to look after the sick and
wounded men of Company C, took us to Richmond
to a hotel where we went to bed. In a day or two
we were sent with other sick and wounded to
Lynchburg, and from there I went home and remained
until restored to health, after a long spell of
sickness.</p>

<p class='c000'>The brigade was engaged in the fight on the 30th
of June at Frazier's Farm, though I don't think
many were killed.</p>

<p class='c000'>As I lay in the tent, I could hear the booming of
the big guns in this battle. The Yankees made a
last stand at Malvern Hill, where, on the 1st of
July, a desperate battle was fought, the Yankees
holding their position until after nightfall, when
they retired to Harrison's landing under the protection
of their gunboats. McClellan was afterwards
called Gunboat McClellan, he having sought the
safety of the gunboats. His initials were G. B.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Seven Days' fighting around Richmond,
the Confederates, according to General Lee's report,
captured more than 10,000 prisoners, fifty-two pieces
of artillery, and 35,000 <a id='thousand'></a>muskets. The
Yankees admit they had 160,000 in the Peninsula
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>campaign, and that there were only 85,000, when
it ended at Harrison's landing on the James River,
fit for duty. The Confederate loss was heavy, but
nothing to compare with the Yankee loss.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c007'>SECOND MANASSAS AND THE MARYLAND CAMPAIGN</h3>

<p class='c008'>Some time after the battles around Richmond, the
brigade set out on what is called the Maryland
campaign. It took part in the second battle of
Manassas, on the 30th of August, 1862, when my
brother, Robert W., who was just eighteen years
old, and had joined the company the day before,
was badly wounded in the thigh. He was taken
to Warrenton, where his father came to him. While
there the latter had a severe spell of typhoid fever.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the fight Company C lost four men killed, as
follows: Harvey Martin, W. H. Hendricks, Chas.
Murrell, and H. O. Elliott, and several wounded.
In this battle the brigade charged and captured a
Yankee battery.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>SHARPSBURG</h3>

<p class='c008'>The brigade was also engaged in the battle of
Sharpsburg, Md., on the 17th of September, 1862,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>when Major Clement was in command of the
Eleventh Regiment and was desperately wounded.
He never again returned to the army. He still lives
in Campbell County, respected and honored by his
people. Adam Clement was a true man, among the
bravest of the brave.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have heard some of Company C relate that on
the evening of September 15th, when near Sharpsburg,
they saw General Lee by the roadside. When
the head of the column, which was falling back
before the Yankee army from the direction of
South Mountain, reached a certain point, General
Lee remarked, as the troops by his order filed off
the road to form line of battle, "We will make our
stand on these hills," and here the Confederates
did make a desperate stand before a largely superior
force, 30,000 against 80,000, and held their ground
to the end. This was a bloody fight, many
thousand men being killed and wounded on both
sides. General Jackson had a few days before
captured Harper's Ferry, with 11,000 prisoners and
large quantities of stores and munitions of war.
Jackson and his men then set out to rejoin General
Lee at Sharpsburg, arriving, some of them, late in
the afternoon on the 17th inst., with ranks much
depleted by the hasty march. But "old Jack" got
there in time to save the day.</p>

<p class='c000'>Company C lost two, and perhaps more, men
killed, as follows: Joe Rice and John Rice, and
several wounded.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>BACK TO VIRGINIA</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>After the battle of Sharpsburg the brigade, with
the Confederate troops, re-crossed the Potomac
River and camped about Winchester until the latter
part of October.</p>

<p class='c000'>I rejoined the army near Winchester about the
25th of September, 1862, going by railroad to
Staunton in company with several men of Company
C, who had been home on sick and wounded
furloughs, from whence we tramped down the pike
and back road, a distance of ninety-odd miles to and
beyond Winchester.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second day, I think it was, we left the rock
road, crossing over to the back road in order to
procure rations more easily along the way, which
we did without any trouble, buying our food from
the farm-houses along the road, and sleeping in the
woods at night. It took four or five days to make
the trip.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the main army, the brigade left Winchester
about the 25th of October, marched up the rock
road some distance, then struck across towards the
Blue Ridge, wading the Shenandoah River, waist-deep
or more. Along the farther side of the river,
I remember there were some grand old sycamore
trees growing with wide-spreading branches.
Whenever I read of or hear Stonewall Jackson's
dying words, "Let us cross over the river and rest
under the shade of the trees," I think of those sycamores
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>on the Shenandoah, under which I have no
doubt Jackson and his men rested in the long ago.</p>

<p class='c000'>We crossed the Blue Ridge at Thornton's Gap,
not far from Sperryville, passing through Madison,
Rappahannock, Orange, and Culpeper counties.
Through Madison County the road ran for some
distance along Robinson River, which has the
rockiest bed I ever saw, literally covered with small
boulders, not very small at that, some of them. We
arrived at Culpeper Court House about the 3d of
November. In the meantime, the enemy had
crossed the Potomac and were then near Warrenton,
Fauquier County, and about the middle of
November moved towards Fredericksburg.</p>

<p class='c000'>The army remained in Culpeper and Orange
counties until about the 19th of November, 1862,
when it moved on towards Fredericksburg, where
the brigade arrived about the 25th of November,
stopping by the way several times, going through
the Wilderness country—large tracts of woodlands,
miles and miles in extent, which afterwards became
famous as the ground on which several bloody
battles were fought—a part of the way along the old
plank-road, going into, as was thought, winter
quarters, building "dog houses," some two miles
south of Fredericksburg.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Yankee army, now commanded by General
Burnside, was in camp on the opposite side of the
Rappahannock River, on what was called Stafford
Heights, which overlooked the town and country on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>the south side, their thousands of white tents being
in plain view from the hills on the south side of
the river.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Yankees always camped in the open fields,
where they pitched their tents. The Confederates
camped in woods after the first year, when improvised
shelters were used, for few were the tents
they had.</p>

<p class='c000'>The camps of both armies extended along
the river, on either side, some twelve or fifteen
miles. The picket lines were along the river banks,
in sight of each other, but no firing was done;
instead, the soldiers sometimes clandestinely crossed
over, swapping tobacco and coffee—the "Johnnies,"
as the Yankees called the Confederates, having the
tobacco, and the "Yanks" the coffee. Newspapers
were also exchanged.</p>

<p class='c000'>While here many of the men were without shoes,
and beef hides were issued to make moccasins, but
this was a poor shift for shoes, and did little or no
good.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c007'>THE BATTLE OF FREDERICKSBURG</h3>

<p class='c008'>Longstreet was in command of the corps, and
Gen. Geo. E. Pickett was the division commander,
having been assigned to the division in September.
The hills along the south side of the river on which
Lee's army was encamped are from a half to a mile
back from the river, broad bottom lands intervening
between the river and hills. When the line of battle
was formed, Jackson's Corps was on the Confederate
right, Longstreet on the left, and Kemper's Brigade
on Longstreet's right flank, and about the center of
the line of battle, which was some four miles long.</p>

<p class='c000'>Jackson being on the right, no one was uneasy
about that wing; Longstreet on the left, with
General Lee near him, all felt at ease, and with
Pickett's Division about the center, we were sure of
success.</p>

<p class='c000'>I don't know whether the Yankees knew
Kemper's Brigade was in the center or not; one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>thing certain, they did not attack this part of the
line. I for one was very glad of it, and I think I
had company.</p>

<p class='c000'>It had been rumored about camp for some time
that the Yankees were about to cross the river and
give battle. On the morning of the 11th of December
the rumor proved true—the Yankees were
preparing to cross now, beyond a doubt. I remember
when we were aroused early that morning by the
Yankee guns shelling the town, I exclaimed, "Poor
old Fredericksburg!" It was not a part of General
Lee's plan to seriously contest the crossing; only
one brigade, Barksdale's Mississippians, who occupied
the river front, in and just below the town
as pickets, made any resistance. They, however,
drove back several times the pontoon bridge-builders
before they succeeded in laying their bridges across
the river, which is here about 300 yards wide. It
was not until the afternoon of the 12th that the
Yankee army had crossed over. On the morning of
the 13th of December, 1862, when the line of battle
was finally formed for the big fight, I remember General
Kemper rode out in front of each regiment of
his brigade and spoke to the men, urging them to do
their duty, saying among other things, "If we can
whip the enemy here to-day, I tell you from what
I know, the Confederacy is surely established."
But alas! he did not know. The enemy was badly
whipped that day, but the Confederacy failed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>As before said, the Yankees did not attack the
center of the Confederate lines, but tried both the
right and left wings about the same time. The
morning of the 13th of December was very foggy
along the river bottoms, and it was some time after
sun-up, perhaps nine or ten o'clock, before the fog
lifted and the battle commenced. Soon after the
firing began on the right and left, Kemper's
Brigade was marched back off the line of battle up
on a hill, so as to be in position to give support
wherever needed. While lying down there a big
shell from a Yankee gun across the river was fired
at the line. The big, long shell, "camp kettles," as
they were called, struck the ground near by, but
did not explode—it just tipped along through the
chinquapin bushes like an old hare and then lay
still; no one went out to investigate—all were glad
it did not burst, and just "left it be." They did not
throw any more over there; all were glad of that,
too, but did not let the Yanks know it; we just
laid still, and like Pete Vaughan's bear, "never said
a word," nor made any sign of approval or disapproval.</p>

<p class='c000'>From where the brigade lay on this hill, the
Yankee lines advancing on Jackson's position could
be plainly seen, but Jackson's men could not be seen—only
the smoke from their guns, the men being
concealed in the woods.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>SPECTACULAR SCENE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>This battle scene was a grand spectacle—more
like some great panoramic picture of a battle than
anything I saw during the war. Ordinarily, very
little of a battle is seen by the troops engaged or in
reserve, the reserve forces being generally concealed
as much as possible from the enemy, and the troops
engaged too busy to pay any attention to what
is going on except in their immediate front. Most
of the fighting is done in the woods.</p>

<p class='c000'>Three times with triple lines of battle the Yankees
advanced across the open field to within musket
range of Jackson's men, the artillery on each side
belching forth shot and shell, grape and canister
the while, and each time upon receiving a deadly
fire, halted and then began to waiver, give back,
scatter and finally disappear over the rise in the
ground, out of sight and out of range, leaving many
dead and wounded behind.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Yankee officers on horseback could be seen
riding hither and thither among the men. One
fellow on an iron-gray horse was particularly active
and conspicuous, seeming to be doing his utmost to
urge his men forward, but all to no purpose. They
had run up against "Stonewall," and they had no
better success than their comrades, who about the
same time were butting up against a rock wall at
the foot of Marye's Hill, on the Confederate left.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>We could see the Yankee ambulances busy hauling
the wounded across the river and up the hills
beyond, to the hospitals.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the time we could hear the roar of the battle-tide
to the left, as well as see and hear it on the
right. The booming of the cannon, the bursting of
the shells, and the long, deep, continuous roar of the
musketry, made a noise as if all nature was in
convulsion.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Then shook the hills with thunder riven,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then rushed the steed to battle driven,</div>
      <div class='line'>And louder than the bolts of heaven,</div>
      <div class='line'>Far flashed the red artillery."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The big Yankee guns over the river punctuating
the noise with frequent loud and long sounding
booms, followed by the screams of the big shells, as
they sped across the river, the reply of the Confederates'
heavy guns—all sounded like "pandemonium
broke loose"—whatever that is—or like the crash
of worlds in the coming clash of the spheres, if ever
God Almighty lets loose the reins that hold them in
their orbits. It has been said that during this battle,
General Lee remarked to some one, "This is grand;
it is well that it does not come often. We would
become too fond of such things."</p>

<h3 class='c007'>BEHIND MARYE'S HILL</h3>

<p class='c008'>Soon after the Yankees got enough of Stonewall's
men on the right, and while the battle was still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>raging on the left, Kemper's Brigade was called to
"attention," and marched off in quick time to the left
towards Fredericksburg; going to support the troops
on Marye's Hill, who had borne the heat and burden
of the day on that wing, passing Gen. R. E. Lee on
the road, standing by his war horse, "Traveler,"
with his staff about him, on a high point from where
he could "view the landscape o'er," and a large part
of the battlefield as well; I think, however, General
Lee was giving more attention to the battle than
to the landscape. A battery of heavy artillery was
near by, engaged in a duel with the Yankee guns
across the river. The brigade did not halt to act
as a second in that duel, but hurried on down the
telegraph road towards Fredericksburg.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just about the time the head of the column
reached the foot of the long hill, and filed to the
left, a Yankee battery from somewhere, presumably
from across the river, commenced throwing shells
right into the line, exploding in the midst, and
knocking men right and left. A few feet in front I
saw a shell explode and knock several men of
Company H heels over head. All were now moving
at a run and soon got out of range of this battery,
crossing Hazel Run, and going in the rear of
Marye's Hill, lying down there until dark, expecting
to be called into action at any moment. But
Generals Ransom and Cobb, with their gallant North
Carolinians and Georgians, stood like statues behind
the rock wall—with the now famous Washington
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>Artillery, under Colonel Walton, behind them on
the crest of the hill—and repulsed with great slaughter
the frequent and desperate assaults made by the
enemy in columns of whole divisions, literally covering
the ground with dead Yankees. Not during the
war was any piece of ground so thickly covered
with dead men as this.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some years ago I talked with a Yankee soldier
who was in one of the assaulting columns at this
place, who described the situation there in front of
the Confederate lines as, "a hell on earth."</p>

<p class='c000'>Six separate and distinct assaults the Yankees
made with divisions heavily massed, but all failed.</p>

<p class='c000'>While the brigade lay just back of the hill, spent
balls came over from the front, dropping among the
men, and now and then wounding some one—a very
uncomfortable position to be in, though not very
dangerous; the balls had hardly force enough to kill,
yet they hit pretty hard. I remember Captain
Houston, of Company K, had the breath fairly
knocked out of him by being struck about the short
ribs with a spent minie ball. The surgeon made an
examination and found the skin had not been
broken, only a severe bruise, whereupon he remarked,
"It is only a furlough wound." No enemy
was in sight upon whom the fire could be returned;
all that could be done was to lay low, hug mother
earth, and await events.</p>

<p class='c000'>About sundown the firing ceased and the battle
of Fredericksburg was over, though no one knew it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>The Yankees had been beaten back at every point
they assailed the Confederate lines, but were not
routed nor driven back across the river. General
Lee, standing on the defensive all this day, still
stood awaiting another attack, but none came.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have often thought how presumptuous it was in
Burnside to attack Lee and Jackson in their chosen
position; although his forces greatly outnumbered
theirs, yet he stood no earthly chance of driving the
Confederates from their position. General Burnside
used no strategy or tactics in this battle; he
just hurled his massed forces against Lee's lines.</p>

<p class='c000'>"On to Richmond" was the clamor at the North,
and Burnside had to do something. He got soundly
whipped, for a fact.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>SHARP-SHOOTING</h3>

<p class='c008'>At dark the brigade went around the hill to the
left and relieved the troops who had been fighting
all day. The Eleventh Regiment was placed in a cut
in the road on the outskirts of the town, just to the
left of the stone wall, remaining here that night,
and the next day, sharp-shooting with the Yankees
posted in the houses of the town. If a head was
raised above the bank for half a minute, "sip"
would come a minie ball, the Confederates returning
the fire, giving the Yankees tit-for-tat—shot
for shot.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was fun for some of Company C to place a hat
or cap on a ramrod, raise it slowly above the bank,
and as soon as the Yankee ball whizzed by, rise up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>and fire at the door or window from whence the
puff of smoke came. Some of them would raise a
hand above the bank and say, "Look, boys, I am
going to get a furlough wound," but they would hold
it there only a second, lest it be struck sure enough.
I saw here one of the men fire upon two Yankees,
one on the back of the other, who let his charge
drop at the crack of the gun. I have often regretted
not preventing this shot. It was a case of one
comrade helping a sick or wounded friend. Then
we looked upon them as deadly enemies, and they
were, too; revengeful, vindictive, and cruel.</p>

<p class='c000'>All that day and the next, the 14th and 15th, the
two armies lay still, only engaging in sharp-shooting
and picket-firing along some parts of the line. On
the night of the 15th, the Yankees, like the Arab,
folded their tents and quietly stole away in the night,
re-crossing the river on their pontoon bridges, which
they drew ashore on the north bank, and again all
was quiet along the banks of the Rappahannock;
"no sound save the rush of the river." But many a
soldier was "off duty forever."</p>

<p class='c000'>In the battle of Fredericksburg the Yankees
admitted the loss of between twelve and fifteen
thousand men killed, wounded and captured, while
the Confederate loss was comparatively light.</p>

<p class='c000'>The brigade, on the 16th, marched back a mile
or two south of Fredericksburg, camping in the
woods near Guinea Station, on the Richmond, Fredericksburg
&amp; Potomac Railroad, where big snowball
battles were fought, regiment pitted against regiment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>the field officers on horseback taking part, and
getting well pelted too.</p>

<p class='c000'>While in camp near Fredericksburg, John Lane,
a young soldier of Company C, died. He had been
sick only a few days. One evening we had orders
to be ready to march at sun-up the next morning.
I got up that morning quite early to look after him
and get him in the ambulance. I first went to
where he was sleeping to enquire how he was. I
found him lying between two of his sleeping
comrades, stark and cold in death, his bed-fellows
being unaware that he had passed away while they
slept. Blood-stains on his lips told that he had died
of hemorrhage. We remained in the vicinity of
Fredericksburg until the latter part of February,
1863. Just before the brigade moved from here, an
order came to detail one officer from each regiment
to go home for supplies of shoes, socks, and
clothing for the men. Maj. Kirk Otey, who was in
command of the regiment, very kindly gave me this
detail without solicitation on my part. Of course, I
was delighted to go home, and be with the loved
ones, but this great pleasure ended very sadly
indeed. A terrible stroke fell on my wife and myself
in the death of our little boy, Dixie, who was
then nearly eighteen months old. We had gone
from my father's, where my wife made her home
during the war, to her father's, Capt. William
Cocke, when our little boy was taken with a severe
spell of acute indigestion, which threw him into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>convulsions, caused congestion of the brain, and in
spite of all that loving hearts and hands and medical
skill could do, he died in a few days. We laid him
to rest in the old family graveyard at Shady Grove
with sad, sad hearts. The day after he was buried
I had to leave home for the army, the time of my
detail having expired, and the rules of war being
inexorable, I had to go. My wife was inconsolable.
It was with a sad and heavy heart I left her in care
of those I knew full well would do all for her that
human love and sympathy could do. Duty called
me hence and I had to obey.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c007'>TO RICHMOND</h3>

<p class='c008'>While I was away Pickett's Division and other
troops under Longstreet left the vicinity of Fredericksburg,
marched to and through Richmond, and
camped on the 13th of February, 1863, near Chester
Station, on the Richmond &amp; Petersburg Railroad.
I heard some of the men say, that when bivouacked
here, while the army slept under their blankets
a heavy snow fell, enveloping all in a mantle of
white while sleeping comfortably and quietly until
day dawned, unconscious of the additional cover
spread over them during the night. I rejoined the
command about that time, and later we marched to
the south side of Petersburg, protecting forage trains
down towards Suffolk.</p>

<p class='c000'>After marching in Southside, Va., for a few
days, through Southampton and other counties,
where we got some of the splendid hams—the finest
I ever ate—for which this section is justly famous,
one afternoon our mess bought some fresh herring.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>That night we ate all we could for supper and covered
the rest up in the leaves for breakfast. But
we were aroused at daybreak the next morning,
and left for Petersburg, leaving the herring there in
the woods. I often afterwards thought of and
wished for those fish.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>OFF FOR THE OLD NORTH STATE</h3>

<p class='c008'>About the 20th of March, 1863, the brigade took
the train at Petersburg for North Carolina. We were
in box-cars, and built fires of pine wood on piles of
dirt in the cars. It was very cold, and all were well
smoked. We went by way of Weldon to Goldsboro,
going into camp in the long-leaf pine woods just
north of the town.</p>

<p class='c000'>While here three men were shot for desertion.
All the regiments were drawn up around the
victims, who were bound to stakes in hollow
square formation, one side of the square being open.
A detail of eighteen men, one-half of whom had
balls in their guns and the other half without balls,
did the shooting. I don't remember to what commands
these deserters belonged; I am sure none of
them belonged to the Eleventh Regiment. This was
to me a sickening spectacle, never witnessed before
or afterwards. Very few Confederate soldiers
suffered a like fate. It was necessary to make
examples sometimes.</p>

<p class='c000'>From Goldsboro we went to Kinston, on Neuse
River, remaining here several days, and then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>marched to New Berne, lower down the Neuse—where
there was some fighting with the Yankees
who occupied the town. The Eleventh Regiment
was not engaged. It was expected the place would
be attacked, but it was not. General Pickett was
in command.</p>

<p class='c000'>I remember it was after night when the vicinity
of New Berne was reached by Kemper's Brigade.
Company C was detailed for picket duty. The company
was conducted out through the pitch darkness,
the night being foggy and very dark, by a guide
sent for the purpose, who led us for some distance
across an open field, finally posting the company
with instruction to keep a sharp lookout for the
Yankees in our front. When morning dawned, it
was discovered that the company was one-half
mile away from where it was intended to be posted,
and facing in the wrong direction.</p>

<p class='c000'>While in North Carolina, rations were plentiful,
sweet potatoes and rice especially, also black-eyed
peas, cornbread and bacon, all of which were greatly
enjoyed, for rations had been pretty short in Virginia
for some time. The country down on Neuse
River was very rich and productive, large quantities
of corn being raised, and while the troops occupied
the country and kept the Yankees in their strongholds
near the coast, foragers were busy with the
wagons hauling out provisions and supplies for the
army in Virginia.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>There were some fine old plantations and homes
in this rich lowland country, where once prosperity,
peace and happiness reigned; but now all was
changed; the ruthless hand of a cruel and relentless
enemy had been laid upon the country along the
coast, the towns were in his possession, and the
country and people for many miles back wore an
aspect of gloom and despair, with many lone
chimneys standing out as grim monuments to
Yankee vandalism.</p>

<p class='c000'>While at Kinston, Lieut. John W. Daniel, later
United States Senator, who was then adjutant of
the Eleventh Regiment, was promoted to major and
ordered to report to Gen. Jubal A. Early, for duty
as chief of staff, which position he filled with credit
and distinction until he fell desperately wounded at
the battle of the Wilderness, and as all know,
maimed for life. What a name and fame he won
in civil life is known of all men.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>BACK TO VIRGINIA</h3>

<p class='c008'>About the 4th of April, 1863, the brigade left
North Carolina by train for Franklin Station, Va.,
south of Petersburg, on Blackwater River. In a
few days, with other troops under the command of
General Longstreet, we crossed Blackwater River
and marched down near Suffolk, and had several
skirmishes with the Yankees, who occupied the
town. No attempt was made to capture the place. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>think the object of the expedition was to give the
Confederates an opportunity of gathering supplies
along the Blackwater River and beyond, and by
threatening Suffolk, prevent the Yankees sending
reënforcements to Hooker, whom Lee was confronting
on the Rappahannock.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Confederates had a line of breastworks extending
out from the Dismal Swamp at right angles
on either side of the main road to Suffolk to another
swamp on the left, with an abattis in front, but as
usual the Yankees did not attack. There was also
one or more batteries of artillery along, and some
cavalry.</p>

<p class='c000'>The picket line was about 1,000 yards to the front,
at the further edge of a pine thicket, with open fields
in front, extending towards Suffolk, though we were
not in sight of the town; there were rifle-pits every
few yards along the picket line.</p>

<p class='c000'>One day while here the Yankees came out from
Suffolk in force, drove in the pickets, and placed a
battery in position in sight of the breastworks 800
yards away, and opened fire. The works were at
once manned, and two batteries vigorously returned
the fire of the enemy. All were expecting an attack
on the breastworks and were prepared to meet it,
but it did not come. It was not long before a shell
from one of the Confederate guns struck and exploded
an ammunition chest of a Yankee gun, at
which a wild cheer went up from the Confederate
lines, whereupon the Yankees broke and ran for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>dear life, leaving a disabled limber and one or more
dead men on the ground. The captain of our
battery had measured the distance from the breastworks
to the point where the Yankees planted their
battery, and knew exactly how to cut the fuse to do
effective work. A Yankee detail returned the next
day under flag of truce to get their dead, and said,
"When you fellows raised that yell, we thought you
were charging us, and we decamped in short order."
The "Rebel yell" had terrified them again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another day, when Company C and Company D
were on picket, the Yankees came out again. We
could see the skirmishers deploying across an open
field half a mile or more to the front, while their
main body marched along the outside of the road
fence in columns of fours, partially hid by trees
and bushes. On they came, nearer and nearer, until
the skirmishers reached a fence running parallel
with our line some distance in front, rather out of
range of our guns; here they halted and commenced
shooting at long range. Expecting the main body
to advance and attempt to drive us back from the
picket line, we occupied the rifle-pits, and Captain
Houston and myself tried to restrain the men from
returning the fire until the enemy was in good range,
but when the balls would come whizzing by, whacking
the trees behind us, some of the men would
crack away now and then in spite of us, but did not
hit any of the Yankees.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>While this was going on, a black smoke burst
forth from a large dwelling-house about 150 yards
in our front, on the right of the road, the inmates,
women and children, running and screaming from
the burning house. The vandals had set fire to
that house and burned it with all its contents,
leaving those women and children homeless and
helpless, only, as they said, because some of the
Confederate pickets had been going there and
getting something to eat. The miscreants left when
the flames enveloped the house.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Confederates gave them a parting volley,
together with a loud cheer of derision and defiance.
One of the Yankees was seen to fall, but got up
again and went on. Sam Franklin, of Company C,
took deliberate aim at this man in the road. At the
crack of his gun the Yankee fell prone to the
ground, when Sam cried out exultingly, "I got
him; I got him." As the Yankee struggled to his
feet and moved off down the road, Sam's exultant
tone changed to one of chagrin, as he said, "No, I
didn't; he's got up and gone." The Yankee went
off; we never knew whether he had a bullet hole
in his measly hide or not. No doubt all of us hoped
he had, and that it had reached a vital spot.</p>

<p class='c000'>After remaining near Suffolk several days longer,
the command returned to Franklin Station, which
place was abandoned on the —— day of May.
Marching through the country, Petersburg was
reached the 9th of May, 1863. From thence we went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>to Taylorsville, in Hanover County, remaining at
the latter place until about the 3d of June.</p>

<p class='c000'>This falling back from Suffolk was done in
regular military order, as if expecting the enemy to
make a hot pursuit. The trees along the roadside
were chopped nearly down by the corps of sappers
and miners—"<em>sappling</em> miners," as some of the boys
called them—ready to be felled across the road by
a few licks of the axe when the rear guard had
passed. At the bridge across Blackwater, troops
were deployed in line of battle on either side of the
road; the artillery was also in position, in battery,
unlimbered and ready for action; General Longstreet
was at the bridge seeing to it that every detail
was carried out. But the enemy made no effort to
pursue. I think the bridge was destroyed after all
had crossed over.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the meantime General Lee had, on the 1st to
5th of May, fought and won the battle of Chancellorsville,
where the immortal "Stonewall" Jackson
fell.</p>

<p class='c000'>While down on the Dismal Swamp the echoes of
the great guns, away up on the Rappahannock, could
be heard rolling through the swamps and lowlands;
loud-mouthed messengers, telling of the deadly
struggle raging far away.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c007'>PENNSYLVANIA CAMPAIGN</h3>

<p class='c008'>These troops—Pickett's Division and others—that
had been in North Carolina and southeast of
Petersburg since February, as before said, halted at
Taylorsville, where they remained until the 3d of
June, 1863. Leaving Corse's Brigade at Taylorsville,
they then set out to join General Lee's
army. Of course, no one knew where we were
going, nor what General Lee's plans were.
We were going to join "Mars Bob," and follow
where he might lead. The Gettysburg or Pennsylvania
campaign having been determined on, General
Lee was gathering in all available troops. The
battles around Chancellorsville had been fought and
won without Longstreet and his legions, except
McLaw's Division, but now they were again to play
an important part in the army of Northern Virginia.
We marched through the counties of Hanover,
Spottsylvania, Orange, and Culpeper.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the march I was taken sick, riding in an
ambulance part of the way; the night before reaching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>Culpeper Court House I was quite ill. The next
morning I was sent in an ambulance to Culpeper
Court House to be forwarded to Lynchburg. At
Culpeper I stopped at the hotel, where I went to
bed until the next morning, when I got aboard the
train for Lynchburg. The ladies at Culpeper were
very kind to me, as they were to all soldiers, doing
everything in their power for the Confederates all
over the South.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the train near Charlottesville I met Dr. G. W.
Thornhill, who had been the regimental surgeon
until a short while before, and with whom I had become
quite intimate. The doctor was very kind, and
before we got to Lynchburg, told me I need not
go to the hospital, he being the chief surgeon in
charge, but to a private house, and that his ambulance
would be at the dépôt. When we got to
Lynchburg, he took me to his ambulance, telling the
driver to take me wherever I wished to go, saying
he would come to see me every day. I went out
on College Hill to my brother-in-law's, Mr. Geo.
A. Burks, where, of course, I had the best of attention,
and Dr. Thornhill, true to his promise, visited
me daily. My wife and father came up at once, the
former remaining with me until I was able to go
out home in a carriage, which was in about two
weeks. Dr. Thornhill said he had no authority to
issue sick furloughs, but that I could go home, stay
until I was well and report back to him, which I did
in about three weeks.</p>

  <h3 class='c007'>GETTYSBURG</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>General Lee led his army on towards the
Potomac, maneuvering, so as to force the enemy to
evacuate Virginia. The Southern army crossed the
river and invaded Pennsylvania, when the bloody
and ill-fated battle of Gettysburg was fought on
the 1st, 2d and 3d days of July, 1863.</p>

<p class='c000'>On account of this sickness I missed the Pennsylvanian
campaign and the Gettysburg battle, in which
Pickett's Division greatly distinguished itself, making
a name that will live forever. I have often
regretted not being in that charge; may be, if I had
been there I would not now be writing these
reminiscences.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the battle of Gettysburg the loss was very
heavy. Company C lost six men killed as follows:
Lieut. James Connelly, M. M. ("Boy") Mason,
Daniel Pillow, Charles Jones, Dabney Tweedy, and
Lanious Jones. Lieutenant Connelly and Daniel
Pillow were reported missing; that is, no one saw
them fall and they were never heard of afterwards,
and no doubt died on that bloody field doing their
duty. They were brave and faithful soldiers. I
was told by some of the company that when the
command came to charge, after the heavy cannonading
had ceased, Charles Jones was among the
first on his feet, and although only a private, called
out, "Come on, boys, let's go and drive away those
infernal Yankees." He died game. It was also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>said of Dabney Tweedy, that as he was borne to the
rear on a stretcher, his lifeblood fast flowing, he sang
with his last breath a hymn he and his mess were
wont to sing in camp. The company also had a number
of men wounded. J. C. Jones lost an arm; my
brother Robert W., was wounded in both feet.
While going forward in that desperate charge the
latter was struck with a minie ball on the instep of
the right foot. Stopping to ascertain the extent
of the wound, and "to see if I was hurt bad enough
to go to the rear," as he expressed it, another ball
struck his left foot just at the root of the third or
fourth toe, tearing its way through the full length of
his foot, and stopping in the heel. Hesitating no
longer, he picked up his own and another musket that
lay near by, which had fallen from the hands of some
dead or wounded comrade, and using them as
crutches, hopped to the rear, when he was taken
charge of by the faithful negro servant, Horace,
who had been with us from the beginning and remained
faithful until the end. Horace, by taking
Robert on his back, when no other means of conveyance
was at hand, and by getting him in an ambulance
or wagon when possible, brought him safely
out of the enemy's country, across the Potomac, on
down the Valley to Staunton, and in due time landed
him safely at home, where our mother showered
thanks on, and almost embraced, the faithful servant
for bringing her boy home. I was at home when
he arrived. The negroes were very faithful during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>the war, and I have always had kindly feelings towards
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Robert remained at home until his wounds were
healed, when he joined the command, and did faithful
service to the end.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>BACK TO VIRGINIA</h3>

<p class='c008'>General Lee re-crossed the Potomac ten days after
the battle of Gettysburg, and crossed the Blue Ridge
into Culpeper County soon afterwards.</p>

<p class='c000'>I rejoined the command about the last of July in
Orange or Culpeper County.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no more fighting that summer between
the main armies of Northern Virginia and the army
of the Potomac, as the Yankees called their "grand
army," greater by far in numbers and resources
than the army of Northern Virginia, but deficient
in leaders when compared with Lee and Jackson,
and not equal in the courage and dash that enabled
the much smaller army of Southerners to beat them
on nearly every battlefield.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lee and Jackson had a way of throwing a large
body of men upon certain portions of the Yankee
lines during a battle, generally striking them in the
flank. Both as strategists and tacticians they were
unsurpassed. They could combine armies and concentrate
forces in action with the greatest skill,
which are the true tests of military genius.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Lee's army was much exhausted and depleted by
the spring and summer campaigns—the great battles
around Chancellorsville—which began on the 1st of
May and ended on the 5th, on the night of which
day the Yankees, badly beaten, stole back over the
Rappahannock River, glad to escape; the three
days' fighting at Gettysburg, in the first two of
which the Confederates were successful, but failed
on the third day because Pickett's men were not
properly supported.</p>

<p class='c000'>The armies lay on either side of the Rapidan, on
the south side of which General Lee had taken position,
while the Yankees confronted him on the north
side, the two armies stretching up and down the
river for many miles. Later General Lee retired
south of the Rappahannock.</p>

<p class='c000'>The army of Northern Virginia, while its ranks
were much depleted by the many bloody battles of
the year (and many were footsore and weary from
the long marches, ragged and dirty as they were),
yet the men were not dispirited nor had they lost
faith in their great leader, upon whom all looked as
the greatest captain of the age. I know full well the
sentiment among the men was, that the failure at
Gettysburg was due, not to General Lee's want of
skill and ability as a leader, but to the tardiness of
Longstreet, and his failure to support Pickett's
charge. The men knew well where the fault lay, and
were not slow to express themselves.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>GENERAL LEE AND THE ARMY OF NORTHERN<br /> VIRGINIA</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In August or September, after the men had
rested and the army had been recruited by the return
to duty of many sick and wounded, there were
general reviews. The whole army, of every branch—infantry,
artillery, and cavalry—was drawn up
in columns of regiments, brigades, and divisions, in
large open fields, General Lee and his staff riding
along the lines of each command, and then all
marched by the reviewing station, showing by the
steady and firm step and soldierly bearing that they
were not disheartened, but ready to go whenever
their trusted and beloved commander might point
the way. While other commanders were often
criticized, never a word of censure of General Lee
escaped the lips of his men; he was "Mars Bob"
and "Uncle Bob" with them, and whatever he did
was right, in their estimation.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have just spoken of General Lee as the greatest
captain of the age, and so he was; I am equally
sure that the army of Northern Virginia was never
excelled in the annals of the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>Without this army Lee and Jackson could never
have made the name and fame they did. These
generals had confidence in their men, and the men
had confidence in their generals; there was not only
mutual confidence, but mutual love and esteem.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>History records no incidents like those in which,
on two occasions, Lee's men, when he had placed
himself in front to lead desperate charges, cried out,
"General Lee, to the rear"; and private soldiers
actually seized his bridle reins and led his horse
through the lines to the rear saying, "General Lee,
we will attend to this; you go to the rear." I did
not see this, but it is too well authenticated to admit
of question. I am sure there were men in Company
C, and the other companies of the Eleventh Regiment,
who would have done and said the same thing
under like circumstances.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the Bridge of Lodi, Napoleon, after his men
had made two unsuccessful attempts to cross the
bridge and capture a battery, seized the colors and
led a successful charge. Lee's men compelled him
to go to the rear and then made successful charges.
Some one, in writing of this incident in Napoleon's
career, remarked that "any corporal in the French
army should have been capable of carrying the flag
over that bridge." Lee had thousands of privates
capable of leading his horse to the rear and commanding
him to go to the rear. General Lee fully
recognized the prowess of his men, and always
gave them due credit in general orders.</p>

<p class='c000'>I believe the time will come when some great
historian will be raised up to tell the true story of
the Southern Confederacy, of her heroic armies
and matchless leaders; some Gibbons, Burke or
Macaulay; and another Virgil or Homer in a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>epic poem will sing of arms and of men, the like of
which the world has never known. An Englishman
has truly said, "It was an army in which every virtue
of an army, and the genius of consummate generalship,
had been displayed."</p>

<p class='c000'>If Lee and Jackson had lived in the mythological
ages of the world they would have been called the
sons of gods, if not very gods, and the men they led
classed with the heroes who fought under the walls
of Troy.</p>

<p class='c000'>When this history is written the world will be
astonished at the disparity in numbers, equipments,
and resources of the contending armies.</p>

<p class='c000'>"True greatness will always bear the test of time.
The greatness of really great men will grow as the
ages roll by." The fame of Lee and Jackson, and
the army that helped to make them great, will go
down the eons of time, ever increasing, and when
time shall be no more, the echo will be heard
resounding through the corridors of eternity.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c007'>TO TAYLORSVILLE</h3>

<p class='c008'>In the early fall of 1863, the brigade now commanded
by Gen. ("Buck") W. R. Terry, General
Kemper being disabled by wounds received at
Gettysburg, moved down towards Spottsylvania
County, and later, about the 1st of October, 1863,
went into camp near Taylorsville, Hanover County,
which seemed a favorite stopping place. I remember
on this march I wore a pair of new boots. My
feet becoming sore and blistered, I had to fall back
in the rear. I took off the boots and walked in my
socks until the sand worked through, when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>bottoms of my feet began to burn as if walking on
hot embers. I then took off my socks and walked
on, barefooted, until the sand and gravel began to
wear away the cuticle, when I put on my boots
without socks, and limped on, coming up with the
command after dark, which was bivouacked by the
roadside.</p>

<p class='c000'>The brigade remained at Taylorsville until about
the 1st of January, 1864, guarding the railroad
bridges over the North and South Anna rivers, and
doing picket duty to the east down on the Pamunky.
I remember while on picket that fall, the weather
was delightful, the atmosphere pure and clear as
that under the far-famed Italian skies, and how the
boys used to watch the morning-star as it rose high
in the heavens, keeping track of it as late as 10 and
11 o'clock <span class='fss'>A. M.</span>, when it could be seen plainly with
the naked eye, by knowing exactly where to look,
some one always keeping it in sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>The command was quite comfortably situated
here, some building huts or "dog houses" and
chimneys to tents, and as the picket duty was not
very arduous, we had a pretty good time, though
rations were scarce. My memory is at fault as to
the time the brigade was in camp below Richmond
at Chafin's Farm, nearly opposite Drury's Bluff.
At any rate, we were there at one time, and relieved
Gen. Henry A. Wise's brigade. Here we had a
fine camping ground in high, level fields, and expected
to remain some time, but did not tarry very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>long. While here I visited the batteries at Drury's
Bluff, and saw the big guns mounted there, pointing
down a long stretch of the river half a mile or more.
The men here said, that lower down on the bluff
other big guns were in position near the water's edge,
which, they declared, "could blow clear out of the
water any Yankee gunboat that attempted to pass
up the river." The Yankee gunboats at one time
attacked this place, but were driven off in short
order. The Confederate ironclad gunboat, <em>Patrick
Henry</em>, lay at anchor in the river just above the
bluff. This I also visited, going on board, and
inspecting the little monster, small though formidable,
with its ribs of railroad iron, and big guns. I
was struck with how neat and clean everything was
kept—spic and span as any ladies' parlor or drawing-room—the
floors highly polished, the brass work
clean and shining, and the officers and crew very
polite, taking pains and seeming pride in showing
visitors over the boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon after we arrived at Chafin's Farm I went
on some errand for General Kemper or General
Terry (I forget now which was in command) to
Gen. Henry A. Wise's headquarters. I had seen General
Wise before and had heard him speak more than
once, but had never met him. I was struck with
his polite and pleasing manner, and the courtesy
with which he received me. But the man of the
most pleasing and delightful manners I met during
the war was Col. Isaac H. Carrington, provost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>marshal of Richmond. I had occasion once to visit
his office on business and was perfectly charmed
with his urbanity not profuse or embarrassing to
a visitor, but delightfully easy and pleasing was his
manner; I am sure he was a born gentleman.</p>

<p class='c000'>I should have stated before, that in the early fall
of 1863, soon after the brigade and the other
brigades of Pickett's Division had been detached and
sent to Taylorsville, thence below Petersburg, Longstreet
and his other two divisions, Hood's and McLaw's,
were also detached and sent to Tennessee,
where they rendered distinguished service in the
battle of Chickamauga, and later at Knoxville.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>TO NORTH CAROLINA AGAIN</h3>

<p class='c008'>On the 10th of January, 1864, the brigade embarked
on the cars at Petersburg for Goldsboro,
N. C, via Weldon; remained at Goldsboro until
near the last of the month, going thence to Kinston,
on Neuse River.</p>

<p class='c000'>About the 1st of February the brigade, with other
troops under General Pickett, marched to New
Berne, lower down on the Neuse. The town was
invested and there was some fighting, some outposts
taken and prisoners captured as well as considerable
stores, but the town was not attacked, nor
was the Eleventh Regiment actively engaged, though
at one time the brigade was drawn up in line of
battle, and all thought that we were going into a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>fight. I remember as the line was being formed,
seeing the drummers with their drums slung over
their shoulders going back to where the surgeons
had selected a position for the field hospital, to assist
the doctors. I remarked to some one that if I lived
through the war, I intended to have all my boys learn
to beat the drum. Whenever the drummers and the
cavalry were seen going to the rear, some one was
sure to say, "Look out, boys, we are going to have a
fight." The troops marched back to Kinston, thence
to Goldsboro, where we remained until the 20th of
February, when we again marched to Kinston.</p>

<p class='c000'>About this time, I got a twenty-days' furlough and
went home. Many of the officers and men got furloughs
during the winter, as there was little or no
fighting going on.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>MARCHING THROUGH SWAMPS AND SAND</h3>

<p class='c008'>We lived pretty well while marching and tramping
around through the swamps and sands of
Eastern North Carolina, but some of the marches
were very trying. In places the roadbeds were
worn down a foot or two; in rainy weather the
roads would be full of mud and water half-leg deep,
through which we tramped for miles on a stretch,
the roadside being closely bordered with thick-growing
bushes and intertwining vines; it was impossible
to avoid the slush and water. Often when
a particularly muddy stretch of road, or a big, deep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>mudhole was encountered, some wag would call
out, "Boys, you have been looking for a soft place,
here it is." By the "soft place" was meant an easy,
bomb-proof detail, where there was no fighting,
picket or guard duty to perform.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of these marches were made in the night
time, when the men would splash and flounder along
through the mud, some swearing, some laughing and
cracking jokes, and ever and anon, the "Bonnie Blue
Flag," "Dixie," or some other patriotic song would
be started, when the woodland would ring for miles
with the songs, and the echoes go rolling through
the swamps and marshes.</p>

<p class='c000'>In some sections the roads ran through high and
dry lands, the roadbeds filled with loose, white
sand, over which the marching was very laborious;
sometimes through the long-leaf pine turpentine
orchards, as they were called—great forests of tall
pines, the bark from two sides of the trees being
scraped off, with steel-bladed knives on long poles,
many feet from the ground, so that when the sap
rises it exudes freely, running down the trunks of
the trees into deep notches near the ground, cut
with long-bladed axes, made for the purpose, and
then dipped out into buckets and conveyed to the
turpentine distillery.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the winter these scraped-off surfaces are
incrusted with dried rosin, which burns freely when
set on fire, the blaze running up the trees many feet.
On these night marches sometimes the soldiers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>would apply the torch to the rosin-covered trees
along the roadside, when the woods and country
around would be lighted up, the flames leaping up
the tall pines to the very tops; the long, gray moss
hanging in festoons from the branches of the live
oaks interspersed among the pines, the glare of the
long streaks of flame reflecting on the white sand,
scintillating like carpets woven of silver threads and
sprinkled with tiny diamonds; the gloom off in the
woods beyond the penetration of the light, and anon
the hooting of the big owl and the scream of the
nighthawk—all brought to mind scenes described in
fairy tales, where witches and goblins in fantastic
attire and shapes participate in high carnival, reveling
with kindred spirits in some vale of tangled wild-wood,
deep hidden and embossed in the gloom, save
for the glare of the torches of the devotees—while
the gray lines of the soldiers, like grim spectral
figures stalking along betwixt the blazing trees, the
red lights flashing from their burnished muskets
and bayonets, reflected on their begrimed faces,
resembled gigantic and uncanny figures moving
amidst the flames of some plutorion realm.</p>

<p class='c000'>These high, sandy roads traverse the country
between Goldsboro, Kinston, and Tarboro.</p>

<p class='c000'>While I was on furlough, the command went by
train to Wilmington, thence by steamer down Cape
Fear River to Smithville, opposite Fort Fisher,
camping on the seashore, where the men feasted on
oysters and fish.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>After the expiration of my furlough I returned
to the command, which was, when I left home, still
on the seashore, but on my arrival at Wilmington I
met the brigade on the return trip up the river on
the way to Goldsboro, where we remained until the
1st of April, then marched to Tarboro on Tar River,
when some one started a report that "Tar River
was on fire," but the report, like many others circulated
in the army, proved untrue. These rumors
were called "grapevine dispatches," and were
about on a par with the weather man's reports of
to-day. While at Manassas the first year of the
war a report was circulated that the Black Horse
Cavalry had captured the Yankee gunboat <em>Pawnee</em>
on the Potomac River.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE CAPTURE OF PLYMOUTH</h3>

<p class='c008'>On the 15th of April, 1864, the brigade, with
other troops—infantry, artillery, and cavalry, under
the command of Gen. R. F. Hoke, of North
Carolina—marched on Plymouth, which was
captured on the 20th of April, with a brigade of
Yankees, and large quantities of stores, arms, and
provisions. Our little army lived high for a few
days, literally feasting on the fat of the land. While
besieging the town, Company C and Company G of
the Eleventh Regiment had an experience worth
relating; a very trying and disastrous one it was,
too, for these two companies, which I will presently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>relate. Plymouth is situated on the south bank of
Roanoke River, not far from where it empties into
the Albemarle Sound.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Yankees had erected several forts and redoubts
around the place, one of which, Fort Warren,
was about a mile up the river and not in sight of
the town. When the town was invested, Terry's
Brigade, except the Twenty-fourth Regiment, which
went below near the town, was placed in front of
this fort, which could not be seen from where the
lines were first formed, for the woods intervened.
As soon as the lines were established, Company C
was detailed for picket duty and placed along the
farther edge of the piece of woods in which the line
was formed. I walked out in the field to see what
could be seen, and pretty soon came in sight of the
Yankee pickets to the left, one of whom took off
his cap and waved it; I did not return his salute.
About that time there appeared beyond the Yankee
pickets, still further to the left, what I at first
thought was a train of cars. While I was looking
on in astonishment, a puff of smoke burst from the
supposed train with a loud boom and shriek through
the air, which I at once recognized as a cannon shot
and shell. I divined at once, that what I had taken
for a train of cars was a Yankee gunboat steaming
up Roanoke River, though I could not see the river
for the high banks. I don't know whether that
shell was fired at me or not—they may have just
been "shelling the woods"; I was the only Confederate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>in sight of the boat in the direction which it
was fired. If it was, it was a poor shot, it went
high overhead and crashed into the woods beyond.
I did not run, but am pretty certain I ducked my
head, and walked back to the picket line; I did not
return the salutation of the Yankee picket, but
bowed to the shell. It was very hard to keep from
dodging when a shell went by, or a minie ball
whizzed close. I heard a story on one of our generals
who, on one occasion when his men were
dodging at the minie balls, upbraided them, saying,
"Stand up like men and don't dodge," when pretty
quick a shell came very close to the general, who
ducked his head. The men began to laugh, and the
general said, "It is all right to dodge them big
ones."</p>

<p class='c000'>The gunboat steamed on up the river out of sight.
That afternoon or the next morning the Confederate
pickets advanced nearer to, and in sight of
the fort, wading through a swamp in the woods for
several hundred yards from half-leg to knee-deep
in water, to the edge of the field in which the fort
was situated, some 800 or 1,000 yards away.</p>

<p class='c000'>The companies took daily turns at this duty while
the siege of the town lasted.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>COMPANIES C AND G HAVE SERIOUS EXPERIENCE</h3>

<p class='c008'>Now I come to the relation of that trying and
disastrous experience mentioned above. The scare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>I had from the Yankee gunboat and shell was as
nothing compared to this. One morning before
day, Company C and Company G were aroused
from sleep, called to arms, and received instructions
from Colonel Otey, coming from General Terry,
to "march out in the field in front of the fort to
within musket range, open fire and keep down the
Yankee gunners while the Confederate battery
shells the Yankees out of the fort." Company G
was commanded by Lieut. James Franklin, of
Lynchburg, and I, being the senior officer, had
charge of the expedition. As soon as the orders were
received, off we started. Wading through the swamp,
we came out at the picket posts at the edge of the
field when the first streaks of daybreak could be
seen in the east. Company G had not yet gotten out
of the swamp. It being important to get position as
near the fort as possible while it was yet dark, I at
once deployed Company C in skirmish line and
moved forward, leaving word with the pickets for
Company G to come on as soon as they got through
the swamp.</p>

<p class='c000'>We marched on in silence until within about 400
yards of the fort, when all at once, without any
warning, or even saying, "by your leave," the
Yankees let loose the dogs of war upon us, with,
as it seemed to me, all kinds of guns and shot, big
and little—shells, grapeshot, canister, and minie
balls. At this warm and sudden salutation, the men
fell prone to the ground. Thinking that we were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>not close enough to the fort to do much execution
with muskets, I gave the command, "Forward,"
when every man rose to his feet and rushed forward
some distance. When the command, "Lie down and
commence firing," was given, this was at once
obeyed. About this time Company G came up at
double-quick and joined in the firing. All the while
the Yankees were pouring it into us, killing and
wounding a good many. Here the two companies lay
out in the open field without any protection whatever,
without a tree or rock, stump or log to shelter
them, firing at the fort until after sun-up, while the
Confederate battery was trying to shell the Yankees
out of the fort. They were only trying, sure enough,
for I could see the shells bursting high in the air
over the fort, while never a one entered or exploded
near it. I had sent back for more ammunition,
some of the men saying their supply was running
short from the rapid firing, but before the messenger
returned I concluded the right thing to do was to
get away from that place as soon as possible; so I
gave the command, "Skirmish in retreat; double-quick,
march," which was done in full double-quick
time. Sad to say, we left five or six men, good
soldiers, dead on the field, while a number of others
were wounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>Company C lost two good men killed, as follows:
Bennett Tweedy, Wm. Monroe, and I think another,
whose name I do not remember. Among the
wounded was Abner Bateman, who had his right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>arm shattered above the elbow. A section of the
bone was removed by the surgeon, so that afterwards
he had an extra joint, as it were, in his arm.
Company G lost several men also. That night a
detail was sent out and brought off the dead bodies,
which were buried down there in the sands of the
Old North State, where, no doubt, they still lie
mouldering into dust, if not already dust, ere this.</p>

<p class='c000'>I remember when we came back to the line of battle
that morning, F. C. Tweedy, a brother of Bennett,
who from some cause had not gone with us,
came to us and said, "Where is Bennett?" Some
one replied, "Bennett was killed." "Ferd" then threw
up his hands and exclaimed, "Oh, my God!" I shall
never forget the agonized tone of Ferd's voice; it
was if his very soul was pierced through and
through.</p>

<p class='c000'>This fort was manned by 200 men with muskets,
besides the big guns, 32-pounders, mounted on the
parapet; also had sandbags arranged along the
parapet, so as to form loopholes for muskets. These
200 men in the fort, well protected, were shooting
at the 75 or 80 men laying out there in the field,
without the slightest protection—an equal contest
indeed!</p>

<p class='c000'>I have always thought it a "fool order" that sent
these companies out that morning.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was said afterwards, and no doubt true, that a
little lieutenant who had been doing some scouting,
suggested the project to General Terry. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>lieutenant was standing out in the field alone while
the firing was going on that morning, some distance
from the firing line, when the Yankees took a crack
at him with a charge of grapeshot, one of which
struck him in the heel and maimed him for life. We
did not know that he was anywhere near, nor that
he had been wounded until after the fighting was
over. When it was known that he had suggested the
"fool project," I don't think he got much sympathy
from any one.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 20th of April, the troops near the town, by
an assault on and capture of the forts near the
place, compelled the surrender of the enemy. We
could hear the fighting going on down the river a
mile away. All at once the firing ceased and cheering
commenced, when the men began to say, "They
are cheering—sh! sh! Listen, listen! See which
side is cheering!" It was not long before the "Rebel
yell" was recognized, then all knew the day had
been won, when the troops above sent up a mighty
shout in answer to their comrades below.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pretty soon two men in a small boat was seen
pulling up the river towards Fort Warren; all knew
it meant the surrender of the fort, and it was not
long after they landed before the Stars and Stripes
were hauled down, and a white flag run up in its
place. Another mighty cheer went up—the "Rebel
yell"—three times three. It was a glad time when
"Old Glory" slid down the flagpole. Col. Jim
Dearing and a Yankee officer were in this boat.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>The brigade marched down and took possession
of the fort and garrison. Some of the Yankees said
they wanted to see the men who came out in the
field that morning, and lay under their fire for
nearly an hour. They saw them and greatly admired
such courage as was then and there displayed.
They only lost one man, their best gunner, who was
shot through the body while aiming one of the big
guns. The brigade with the prisoners then marched
down to the town, where the other prisoners and
Confederate troops were assembled, when congratulations
and good cheer among the Confederates
were exchanged; all feasting on the good things to
eat and drink captured in the forts and town.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE GUNBOAT "ALBEMARLE"</h3>

<p class='c008'>The capture of Plymouth was greatly aided by the
Confederate ironclad gunboat, <em>Albemarle</em>, built at
Weldon, and commanded by Captain Cooke, of
the navy, which dropped down the river as the
troops marched by land, the movements of each
being timed so as to coöperate in the attack. The
<em>Albemarle</em> glided by the upper fort in the night-time,
the night after the troops invested the town,
dropping down the river near Plymouth, where the
Yankees had three gunboats lying in the river.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Yankees in Fort Warren, which is situated
on the river bank, said they saw the <em>Albemarle</em> as
it passed down the river that night, and had their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>guns trained on it, but did not fire, thinking it was
one of their boats which had passed up the river that
afternoon, which I have already mentioned, but had
returned by another channel, unknown to the
occupants of Fort Warren.</p>

<p class='c000'>These Yankee gunboats were the <em>Southfield</em>,
the <em>Miami</em>, and the <em>Bombshell</em>. There were
three other forts on the land side of the town: Fort
Williams, Fort Wessels, and Fort Comfort. Captain
Cooke lay at anchor until daylight. The Yankees
during the night became aware of his presence, and
made preparations to give him a warm reception
when day dawned. They conceived the idea, so it
was said, of fastening the ends of a long chain to
two of their gunboats, with which they proposed
to drag off the anchor of the <em>Albemarle</em>, by running
a boat on either side of it. Captain Cooke
heard the hammering on these boats during the
night, and divining their scheme, when daylight
dawned, turned the prow of the <em>Albemarle</em> towards
the <em>Southfield</em>, one of the boats to which
the chain was attached, with full steam ahead,
and struck the Yankee boat with terrific force, sending
it to the bottom at once.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Cooke then turned on the <em>Bombshell</em>,
which surrendered. The <em>Miami</em> was next attacked,
when it made its escape by flight down the river.
Her captain was killed, and some of her guns disabled
before she got out of range.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>By this bold and successful stroke of the <em>Albemarle</em>,
the whole river front of the town was exposed
to the fire of the gunboat, and it may be
depended upon that Captain Cooke made good use
of the advantage thus gained. I heard General
Wessels, the Yankee commander, after the capitulation,
berating the gunboats for their failure to
protect his water front, attributing his defeat and
capture to this. This may have been true, but I
hardly think so. General Hoke was a fine soldier
and officer, had gone there to capture Plymouth,
and would have been almost sure to have succeeded
without the aid of the <em>Albemarle</em>, but would have
no doubt lost many more men than he did. The
Confederate loss was small.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was said that there were some negro soldiers
at Plymouth, who took to the swamps, were pursued
by Dearing's Cavalry and left in the swamp, dead or
alive; none of them were taken prisoners, or
brought out of the swamp. Some of the prisoners
captured were identified as deserters from the Confederate
service; a court-martial was convened
later, and several of them were hung. These men
were North Carolinians.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>COL. JAMES DEARING WINS PROMOTION</h3>

<p class='c008'>Col. Jim Dearing, of Campbell County, won his
brigadier-generalship at Plymouth. He was put in
command of the artillery and cavalry by General
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>Hoke. Dearing was a dashing officer, and in this
battle performed his part with great skill and
bravery, charging a fort with artillery, running the
guns by hand right up to the fort, pouring shot and
shell into it until the white flag was sent up. The
first day he surprised, by a quick dash with his
troopers and artillery, another fort, running in on
the Yankees so suddenly that they had no water
to cool their guns, and could only fire a few rounds,
when they sent up a white flag. General Dearing
was mortally wounded in a hand-to-hand fight with
a Yankee officer a few days before the surrender.
This officer also received his death wound in the
encounter. It has been said that General Dearing
was shot by one of his own men, who was trying
to shoot the Yankee officer. Dearing was brought
to Lynchburg where he died in a few days.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>MARCH ON WASHINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA</h3>

<p class='c008'>After securing the trophies of the victory won at
Plymouth, which consisted of 1,600 prisoners, 2,000
muskets, and 25 cannon, and a large quantity of
ammunition and provisions, and sending them up
the country, General Hoke and his little army
marched on Washington, situated about 30 miles
south of Plymouth, on Tar River, near the head of
Pamlico Sound. The town was reached about the
25th of April. The troops formed in line of battle,
ready for the attack, when it was found that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>place had been evacuated by the Yankees, who
doubtless had heard of the fate of Plymouth and
its garrison, and fearing lest they should share a
like fate, had decamped, bag and baggage.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>NEWBERNE AGAIN INVESTED</h3>

<p class='c008'>From Washington the command marched towards
Newberne, situated, as before said, on Neuse River,
not far from where it also enters into Pamlico
Sound, some 35 miles still further south.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 2d of May, the town was invested and
preparation made for the attack, when orders were
unexpectedly received to withdraw and march up
the Neuse to Kinston with all possible speed.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c007'>BACK TO PETERSBURG</h3>

<p class='c008'>Leaving Newberne at night (a pitch-dark night
it was), with the Eleventh Regiment as the rearguard,
we marched up to Kinston, where the brigade
boarded the cars for Goldsboro. As the rearguard
moved off from Newberne, after the other troops
were well on the road, a body of cavalry was heard
approaching, when the regiment halted. A lone
horseman approached, who was stopped by a cry of
"Halt! who comes there?" The horseman replied,
"It's some of <em>we all's</em> men"—a non-committal reply,
to be sure.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a squadron of North Carolina cavalry
coming back to get in the rear of the infantry.
These Tar Heels were as badly scared as we were,
each side taking the other for the enemy. Every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>man had bundles of fodder tied on behind his saddle,
and presented a grotesque appearance in the darkness,
as they passed to the rear.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was soon rumored that we were needed in
Virginia to protect Richmond and Petersburg from
Beast Butler and his army, who had sailed up
James River, and was threatening Petersburg.</p>

<p class='c000'>Arriving at Goldsboro, the train was sent on to
Weldon as fast as steam could carry it, and from
Weldon on towards Petersburg. On reaching
Jarratt's Station, it was found that a body of
Yankee cavalry had come up from Suffolk and
destroyed the railroad, tearing up the track and
burning the bridge over Stony Creek, several miles
further on. Leaving the train at Jarratt's, the
troops marched along the torn-up railroad track to
Stony Creek, when another train was taken for
Petersburg, where we arrived on the —— of May,
1864, none too soon for the safety of the city.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>BEAST BUTLER</h3>

<p class='c008'>Beast Butler had come up James River on transports,
with an army of about 40,000 men, landing
some at City Point, and marched on Petersburg,
while the main body landed at Bermuda Hundred,
higher up the river. This move was no doubt intended
as a diversion to draw troops from General
Lee, who was confronting Grant in the Wilderness,
but was checkmated by drawing troops from other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>points, threshing old Butler, and sending some of
these men on to join General Lee, as we shall
presently see.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the day before we arrived, or that day, I am
not sure which, Butler had advanced a strong
column as far as the Richmond &amp; Petersburg
Railroad, between Richmond and Petersburg, and
destroyed a portion of the same; the column had
been driven back, however.</p>

<p class='c000'>The people of Petersburg gave a joyous welcome
to the Confederates, the ladies greeting and feeding
the soldiers as they marched through the streets.</p>

<p class='c000'>Until the arrival of these troops there was only a
thin line, principally old men and boys, with some
regular troops, holding back the Yankees from
Petersburg. General Beauregard also had, with
other troops, hurried on from the south about the
same time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Butler, with the bulk of his army, now being
between Petersburg and Richmond, threatening
both cities, it was necessary to have troops to defend
each. Dispositions were accordingly made to that
end: General Whiting was left at Petersburg with
about 3,000 troops; Beauregard, who was now
chief commander, with the others, passed on towards
Richmond, and took position opposite Drury's
Bluff, the line extending southwest to the Richmond
&amp; Petersburg Railroad.</p>

<p class='c000'>As Terry's Brigade marched along the country
road towards Richmond, we knew the Yankees were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>only a short distance to the right of the road, though
not in sight. Along the road at Swift Creek the
trees were scarred with bullets fired in the fight a
day or two before.</p>

<p class='c000'>Company C marched on the right flank of the
regiment in single file, and about fifty yards from
the road, as skirmishers, moving silently along
through the pines and bushes, the men five paces
apart, looking out for the Yankees to the right, and
expecting every moment to be fired upon by the
enemy; a right ticklish position.</p>

<p class='c000'>We got through, however, without being attacked.
Hardly had the column passed before the Yankees
came into the road we had marched over, firing upon
the rearguard. The brigade was then halted and
formed in line of battle, expecting an attack, but
none came. The command in the afternoon moved
on a little farther towards Richmond, occupying the
lines between Drury's Bluff and the railroad,
abandoning a line of breastworks, which the
Yankees afterwards occupied.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the next few days there was considerable
fighting along the front lines, principally with
artillery, but our regiment was not engaged.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE BATTLE OF DRURY'S BLUFF</h3>

<p class='c008'>The army lay here on this line until the night of
the 15th of May. Late that afternoon, General
Beauregard had orders given to all the officers, from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>the major-generals down to the company commanders,
for an attack on the enemy's lines at daybreak
the next morning.</p>

<p class='c000'>I remember well, Col. Kirk Otey calling up all
the company commanders of the Eleventh Regiment,
and telling them that General Beauregard had determined
to attack the enemy the next morning, and
had ordered that the troops at dark march to positions
to be assigned them in front of the enemy's
lines, sleep on their arms, and at daybreak the next
morning charge the breastworks in their front.
This was an unusual order; the Commanding
General did not often disclose his plans in this way.</p>

<p class='c000'>And so it was done. Terry's Brigade was moved
to the extreme left of the Confederate lines near
Drury's Bluff. There the brigade lay in the thick
pines with their guns by their sides until morning.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have spent many more pleasant and less anxious
nights than that one. Knowing that when the morning
dawned we would have to face death in front
of the enemy's breastworks was not very pleasant
to contemplate, to say the least. Before daybreak on
the morning of the 16th of May, 1864, the army
was aroused and the men on their feet, ready to do
or die. Many did die that morning, and something
was done, too.</p>

<p class='c000'>The brigade took position in an open field not
far from where the night had been spent, first
marching along the river road, crossing a branch or
small creek near an old mill site, then filing to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>right off the road, and forming line of battle close
to the bushes growing along the branch, with the
open field in front. The morning was dark, a heavy
fog arising from the river enveloping the country
around.</p>

<p class='c000'>About fifty yards in front of the brigade, an
Alabama brigade, commanded by General Gracie,
was forming in line of battle also. This brigade
was the front line. Terry's Brigade was the supporting
line, with orders to keep 200 yards in the
rear of Gracie while advancing, until called on to
go forward. Maj.-Gen. Bushrod Johnson was in
command of this part of the line; General Pickett,
I believe, was at Petersburg; Major-General Ransom,
I think, commanded the front lines.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the right flank of Gracie's Brigade, Hankin's
Battery, of Surry County, was taking position also.
No unnecessary noise was made, no one spoke unless
giving orders, and then in a low tone. The artillery
moved into position slowly, and with as little noise
as possible. I remember well the cluck of the iron
axles as the guns moved slowly into position as
quietly as a funeral procession.</p>

<p class='c000'>When all was ready, and while it was yet dark,
the Alabamians moved forward up the hill, the
artillery keeping pace with them, firing by sections,
each section moving forward after firing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pretty soon the Yankee pickets opened fire on
the advancing column, which it returned, the column
moving on the while, driving the pickets from their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>rifle pits near the top of the hill. On down the hill
General Gracie took his men right into a very heavy
fire, the artillery halting at the top of the hill, still
firing away into the darkness beyond, throwing shot
and shell into the woods in front, where the enemy
is supposed to be.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a grand spectacle that dark morning—the
firing of the battery by sections as it advanced;
the roar of the guns; the flames of fire bursting
forth in the darkness. Though rather awe-inspiring
at the time, it was grand, nevertheless. I shall never
forget the scene.</p>

<p class='c000'>Terry's Brigade followed on and halted at the
top of the hill, some 150 yards in rear of Gracie's,
which was now hotly engaged at the foot of the hill,
many of the Yankee bullets flying over the hill, killing
and wounding several, as the men knelt or sat
on the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>I remember while here, one of Company H, the
next company to Company C, was shot through the
body, and how tenderly an Irish comrade, who was
sitting by his side, took him in his arms and said,
"Poor —— (I forget the name) is killed; poor
fellow," and, "his poor wife and children." It was
truly a pathetic scene in the midst of a battle. I
shall never forget the tender, sympathetic tone of
that Irishman's voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Until reaching this position we were not exposed
to the fire of the enemy, but now the bullets were
whizzing by pretty thick. The enemy seemed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>have no artillery on this part of the line. By this
time day was breaking, but it was still very foggy
and dark.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>GENERAL GRACIE'S COURAGE</h3>

<p class='c008'>Through the mist could be seen stragglers and
wounded men from Gracie's Brigade coming back
from the front, some of them loading and firing as
they fell back; soon larger squads of them came
breaking to the rear, and up the hill came General
Gracie on his horse, cursing and swearing like a
sailor, apparently oblivious of the danger from the
balls that were flying through the air, calling his
men "d——d cowards," and using much strong
language. General Gracie was a stout man with
iron-gray hair and mustache, and was blowing like
a porpoise while riding among his men trying to
rally them. One of his men, a tall, light-haired,
good-looking young man, seemed to resent his harsh
words, saying, "General Gracie, we stayed there as
long as we could." "Yes," replied the General,
"you ran away, too, like d——d cowards"; or, to
be a little more accurate, though not quite exact in
quoting the General's words, "Like d—ned cowardly
sons of —" (female canines).</p>

<p class='c000'>General Gracie rode up to General Terry and
said, "General Terry, send me a regiment down
there to take the place of one of mine that has run
away." Just then one of Company C came up to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>me and said, "It is no use for us to go there; don't
you see they have driven back them men?" I
replied, "Then this is the very time we are needed."</p>

<p class='c000'>General Terry called on the Eleventh and Twenty-fourth
regiments to go forward, and down the hill
the two regiments went at double-quick, with a wild
yell that sounded above the roar of battle.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Twenty-fourth was just on the right of the
Eleventh, with Col. R. F. Maury, sword in hand,
in front, walking backwards, calling on and beckoning
to his men to come on. I noticed Ned Gillam,
a sergeant in Company C, dash to the front as the
line started, look back, open wide his mouth, raise
the "Rebel yell" and press forward, as if breasting
against a heavy storm of wind and rain. (Men in
battle did do this; why, I do not know. The body
would be leaning forward, the face averted as if
the going forward required great physical exertion.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Addison says, "Courage that grows from constitution
often forsakes a man when he has occasion for
it; courage which arises from a sense of duty acts
in a uniform manner." I opine the courage displayed
by General Gracie that morning was of both
kinds. It did not fail him then or thereafter; while
Ned Gillam's was more from a sense of duty. But
I must stop philosophizing in the midst of a battle,
and go on with the fight.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>INTO A HOT FIRE AT CLOSE RANGE</h3>

<p class='c008'>On reaching the foot of the hill, the Eleventh
and Twenty-fourth halted in the edge of the woods,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>where the enemy's fire was very heavy and destructive
at very close range. The minie balls were flying
thick, the "sip, sip, sip" sound they made indicating
unmistakably that the Yankees were close by, though
hidden by the fog, smoke and bushes, and our men,
standing or kneeling, returning the fire with a will.
Here these regiments suffered a heavy loss in a very
short space of time.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>COL. RICHARD F. MAURY</h3>

<p class='c008'>I remember passing Colonel Maury just at the
edge of the woods, lying on his back looking ghastly
pale. I said to him, "Colonel, are you badly
wounded?" He replied calmly, "Yes, very badly."
He recovered from the wound, however, and still
lives in Richmond. Colonel Maury is a son of the
late Commodore Matthew F. Maury, "the pathfinder
of the seas." (Since this was first written the gallant
Colonel Maury has answered the last roll call; peace
to his ashes.) Colonel Maury was a strict disciplinarian
and not very popular in camp, but in a fight
his men stood by him, and died by him.</p>

<p class='c000'>I also remember while kneeling here in the woods,
in this terrific fire, when the twigs around me on
every side were being cut by bullets, and men shot
down on every hand, I felt a sense of safety and
security; it seemed there was a small space or zone
just around my person into which no balls came. I
have often thought and spoken of this, but never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>could account for the impression clearly and distinctly
made upon my mind in the midst of imminent
danger. It may be, at that early hour of morning, a
loved one at home—wife or mother—at her morning
devotions, was at that very moment sending up
an earnest petition to the God of Heaven and
earth, the Maker and Ruler of all things, for my
protection, and that though the petitioner was far
away, the prayer reached the throne of grace and
mercy, and the answer came down there to me in
the midst of that scene of carnage, "Safe"! Who
knows? Maybe in the sweet bye-and-bye I may
know more of this. So mote it be.</p>

<p class='c000'>While here G. A. Creasy, a young soldier of
Company C, who was at my side, spoke out, saying,
"Captain, I am wounded, what must I do?" Looking
at him, I saw the blood running from a wound
in the face. I replied, "Go to the rear," and he went.
Gus still lives in Pittsylvania County.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>YANKEE BRIGADE CAPTURED</h3>

<p class='c008'>It was not long before the word came along the
lines from the left, "Cease firing." The other regiments
of the brigade, and part of Gracie's, on the
left, had advanced, overlapping the enemy's lines on
his right flank, and swinging around, came in on
the enemy's flank and rear.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had surrendered; a whole brigade—General
Heckman, their commander, and all.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>The Eleventh and Twenty-fourth at once went
forward and came upon the Yankee breastworks, not
over twenty steps in front. There the Yankees stood
with their guns in their hands, very much frightened
and bewildered, apparently, and looking greatly
astonished as if something had happened, but not
knowing exactly what; they found out very soon,
though, when, after surrendering their guns, they
were marched to the boat-landing at Drury's Bluff
(escorted by the Seventh Virginia Regiment) and
sent up the river by the boat to Richmond, and into
Libby Prison. My brother Bob said that as he approached
the Yankee breastworks, an officer fired his
pistol into his face, but his aim was bad. Color-Bearer
Hickok also went forward among the foremost,
and was told by the Yankees not to come into
the works, presenting their guns. Hickcock brought
down his flag-staff at a rest, and went ahead, heedless
of their protestations. I saw Major Hambrick,
of the Twenty-fourth Regiment, after the battle was
over, who was also wounded, shot through the
thigh, who said, when asked about his wound,
"D—n 'em, I will live to fight them again." Poor
fellow, he died in Richmond soon afterwards from
his wound.</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time the battle was raging along the lines
for a mile or more. The plan of battle was to first
strike the Yankees on their right flank and follow
it by successive attacks on their line from right to
left, all of which was successfully and handsomely
done before the sun was well up.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>
  <h3 class='c007'>GENERAL WHITING'S FAILURE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>A further plan of the battle was, that General
Whiting, who, as before said, had been left in command
of the troops at Petersburg, was to attack the
Yankees in the rear at the same time they were
assailed in front. This, however, was a miserable
failure. It was said at the time that Whiting was
drunk; how true this was I never knew, he only
marched out of Petersburg and then marched back
again. If the attack in the rear had been made
simultaneously with the one in front, there is no
doubt but that Butler's army would have been
completely crushed, as if caught between the upper
and nether millstones, and captured almost to the
last man, when there would have probably been
a first-class hanging. Butler had been outlawed;
that is, proclamation had been issued by the Confederate
authorities to hang Butler on the spot, if
captured, for his beastly conduct towards the
people, especially the women, of New Orleans, while
in command of that city. Butler had threatened to
turn his soldiers loose upon the women.</p>

<p class='c000'>Col. Geo. C. Cabell used to tell, that when in
Congress he had a talk with Butler about this battle,
and upon Butler's asking him what would have been
his fate if he, Butler, had been captured, Colonel
Cabell said he replied, "I do not know as to the
others, but if my regiment had made the capture,
you would have been strung up at once." A Richmond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>paper described this battle as a contest
between a great eagle and a buzzard. Of course,
the Beast was the buzzard, and Beauregard the
eagle.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the time the sun was an hour high the Yankee
army was in full retreat for its base, Bermuda
Hundred, the Confederates following on, though
the pursuit was not a very vigorous one. All who
knew of the plan of battle were anxiously awaiting
the sound of Whiting's guns in the rear of the
Yankee army, but alas! those guns were silent, and
Beast Butler and his badly beaten army made good
their escape.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the prisoners captured that morning
said they were taken completely by surprise; that
orders had been issued to attack the Confederates at
sunrise. So Beauregard stole a march on them by
attacking at daybreak. The early bird caught some
of the worms that morning, if not all, as was
planned.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beauregard followed on to the top of the river
hills overlooking Bermuda Hundred, where the
Yankees were well fortified, with gunboats in the
river to assist in the defense of the strong position.
Here there was some artillery firing, but no attempt
to assault the position was made. Butler was
"bottled up." In this fight, Company C lost seven
men killed and mortally wounded, as follows: Chas.
Allen, John DePriest, Allen Bailey, John Monroe,
Bruce Woody, Alfred Rosser, and Geo. W. Walker,
and many wounded.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>In a few days the bulk of the Confederate army
went to join General Lee in his death struggle with
Grant and Meade, which had been going on since
the early days of May in the Wilderness and around
Spottsylvania Court House.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>YANKEE FLAGS</h3>

<p class='c008'>On the 20th of May, Terry's Brigade marched
through Richmond, each regiment proudly carrying
a Yankee flag, captured on the 16th of May. The
brigade marched into the Capitol Square, where
there was assembled a great crowd of Congressmen,
high Confederate dignitaries, and others. The troops
were massed in columns of regiments, and there, beneath
the grand equestrian statue of Washington,
these flags were delivered to the War Department
officials. I have no doubt that if Washington was
there in spirit, he looked on approvingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>That afternoon part of the brigade went by train
to Hanover Junction, where troops were assembling
from different quarters to reënforce General Lee,
who had been fighting and holding his own for
nearly three weeks against tremendous odds. But his
ranks had been greatly depleted, while Grant's army
was being reënforced almost daily. Gen. John C.
Breckenridge was here with his troops also. It was
said Breckenridge was the handsomest man in the
army; some of Company C saw him here and
declared he was the finest-looking man they ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>saw. I could have seen him by walking a hundred
or two yards, but did not do so, being very tired
and worn out generally, and sad on account of the
loss of seven good men a few days before.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 id='CHAPTER_XVI' class='c004'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <br /> <span class='sc'>To Milford and to Capture—A Prisoner of<br /> War—On to Washington</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The same afternoon we arrived at Hanover
Junction, the First Virginia Regiment and five
companies of the Eleventh, A, B, C, E and K, under
the command of Major Norten, of the First Regiment,
boarded the cars and went to Milford Station
in Caroline County, on the Richmond, Fredericksburg
&amp; Potomac Railroad, arriving there about
night, and going into camp across the Mattapony
River, just west of the station. The Mattapony
here is quite a small stream, spanned by a wooden
bridge. The First Regiment at that time was very
small, numbering perhaps not over 100 to 150 men.
The five companies of the Eleventh Regiment numbered
about eighty-five or ninety men—Plymouth
and Drury's Bluff had depleted their ranks. Pickets
were posted on the roads, and there were some cavalry
videts still farther out. The rest of the command
bivouacked in the woods a short distance from
the bridge.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early the next morning, the 21st of May, 1864,
the cavalry videts came in and reported the Yankees
were making a raid on the station with the intention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>of burning it. Major Norten declared they
should not do this, and made his dispositions to
prevent it, posting the men of the First Regiment
to repel the attack on the station, while the companies
of the Eleventh were held in reserve.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not long before the supposed raiders made
their appearance. At first they were few in number
and shot at long range, firing on the First Regiment
at the bridge from a grove on a hill some 600 yards
away, with long-range guns, dropping a few balls
about them, while too far away for them to return
the fire with their muskets. Major Norten ordered
up the reserves, directing them to "Take that hill
and hold it at all hazards"—a very positive and
unwise order, I thought.</p>

<p class='c000'>The five companies of the Eleventh Regiment
crossed over the bridge, formed in line of battle,
and moved forward at double-quick across the broad
river bottom, crossing over the railroad track right
up to this hill, taking possession of it without firing
a single gun, the few Yankees who occupied it
retreating before the line was in shooting distance.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as the hill was occupied, no Yankees
being in sight, I walked up on the northeast side of
the grove of trees and saw half a mile away, thousands
of Yankee cavalry; the hills were blue with
them. It turned out to be General Torbet's Division,
the advance division of Grant's army, instead of
a raid to burn Milford Station. I went back and
told Capt. Bob Mitchell, of Company A, who was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>the ranking officer, that we could not hold that hill—that
there were ten thousand Yankees over on the
next hill. Mitchell replied, "We have orders to hold
the hill at all hazards." I said, "All right, we will all
be captured." I have often thought Captain Mitchell
should have sent a messenger to inform Major
Norten of the situation, but he did not. The
Yankee skirmishers, dismounted cavalry, soon began
to advance on two sides of the hill, when a long-range
skirmish began, which continued for some
time, growing hotter as the Yankees approached
nearer and nearer, protecting themselves behind
trees and whatever they could. They were held at
bay for an hour or more. During this time the Confederates
had several men wounded. The Yankees
were being hit also. Captain Mitchell was shot in
the chin and left the hill. Lieutenant Atkins, of
Company K, was also wounded. I saw him clap his
hand on his side as the ball struck him. I never
learned his fate, and I am not certain that I have his
name correct, but know he was a lieutenant of
Company K. Capt. Thomas B. Horton, of Company
B, was next in command. Going again to the
crest of the hill, on the northeast side, I saw a regiment
of dismounted Yankee cavalry forming in line
of battle a few hundred yards away; a colonel or
general with gray hair and mustache was riding
along the rear of the men getting them into position,
the men seeming very awkward and hard to get
straightened out. I called up one of Company C,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>either Tom Rosser or Sam Franklin, both good
fighters, and told him to raise the sight of his
Enfield rifle to 400 yards and shoot that officer. The
order was obeyed promptly; I did not see the result
of the shot however. Just as he fired, one of Company
B, who was lying on the ground on the crest
of the hill firing at the enemy, in a few feet of
where I was standing, attracted my attention by
calling out at the top of his voice, "Run here,
ambulance corps; run here, ambulance corps." Seeing
he had only a scalp wound on the side of the
head, and thinking a man who could call out so
lustily for the ambulance corps to come to his aid,
although his head was bleeding profusely, could aid
himself by getting up and running, I told him so,
whereupon he jumped up and ran like a deer off the
hill. I suppose he got away safely.</p>

<p class='c000'>The men of the companies were scattered around
on the hill, among the trees, embracing about an
acre in area, without any regard to lines, fighting on
the Indian style, some protecting themselves behind
trees, some lying down, while most of them stood
out in the open, watching for and shooting at every
Yankee who showed himself within range. The
Yankees, too, were under cover as much as possible
with longer range guns than ours, slipping around
behind trees, bushes and fences, and at every opportunity
popping away at the Confederates, all the
while getting a little closer and extending their
lines around the hill. They were not very good
shots, however.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>Captain Horton and myself consulted, or held a
small council of war, upon the situation. It was
beyond question that if we remained on the hill, all
would be killed or made prisoners in a short time.
Some, or all of us, might escape by beating a hasty
retreat. We agreed to try the latter, orders or no
orders. Turning to the men who were by this time
pretty close together about the center of the hill,
with the Yankees still closing in, we told them we
would all make a break and attempt to escape.
Many of the men so earnestly demurred to this,
saying, "We will all be killed as we run across the
bottom," that Captain Horton and myself concluded
not to make the attempt. I said to the men, "We
will stay with you then." Near the top of the hill
there was a ditch leading from what appeared to be
an old icehouse, and in this ditch we made the last
stand and fought the Yankees until they were close
up. I remember Marion Seay, of Company E, who
still lives in Lynchburg, was at the upper end
of the ditch, shooting at a Yankee not thirty steps
away, and then calling out and pointing his finger,
saying, "D—n you, I fixed you," repeating it several
times. Seay was then a little tow-headed boy, but
he was game to the backbone.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pretty soon our men ceased firing, as all knew
that the inevitable had come. The Yankees then
rushed up to the ditch, and all the Confederates
dropped their guns—the seventy-five men left were
prisoners of war.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>I think we were justifiable in surrendering. If we
had fought until the last man fell, nothing would
have been accomplished for the good of the cause.
There was no possibility of rescue, so it was die in
that ditch in a few minutes or surrender; we chose
not to die then and there. It was not a forlorn
hope we were leading or defending, which demanded
such a sacrifice of life.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the Yankees came up, one of their men was
shot through the head, and fell dead into the ditch;
killed, I think, by one of his own men who was some
distance off, firing, as he thought, at the Rebels.
Some of the Confederates were bespattered with the
brains of the dead Yankee.</p>

<p class='c000'>At Plymouth, N. C., thirty-one days before, and
again just five days before, at Drury's Bluff, we had
been at the capture of brigades of Yankees, and exulted
in the captures—now the tables are turned and
we are prisoners, and the Yankees are exulting at
our capture. Such are the fortunes of war.</p>

<p class='c000'>I can testify that the sensations of the captors
are very different from those of the captives, but
shall not attempt to set forth the contrast; words are
inadequate.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Yankees said they had thirty-five or forty
men killed and wounded in the fight; so that for
every "Rebel" captured that day, they had half a
man killed or crippled—not a bad showing for the
"Rebs," if they did surrender, when outnumbered
by more than one hundred to one. I don't remember
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>that we had any killed on the field; nearly all
the wounded got away.</p>

<p class='c000'>Capt. Thos. B. Horton, Company B; Lieut. Peter
Akers, Company A, and Lieuts. J. W. Wray and
Geo. P. Norvell, of Company E., were captured.
I have no means of getting the names of the men
of the other companies captured.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beside myself, the following men of Company C
were captured: W. L. Brown, G. T. Brown, J. A.
Brown, H. M. Callaham, H. Eads, J. T. Jones,
J. W. Jones, W. S. Kabler, Fred Kabler, W. T.
Monroe, R. W. Morgan, S. P. Tweedy, E. A
Tweedy, W. A. Rice, W. C. J. Wilkerson—seventeen
in all. W. L. Brown and S. P. Tweedy were
wounded; the former slightly, the latter a bad flesh
wound in the thigh. Some of the company were
on picket duty and escaped capture, and some who
were wounded got away, others were at home, or
in hospitals, sick or wounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not long ago, in looking over some old papers
and letters, I found a letter written by Lieut. Robert
Cocke to my wife, telling her about the fight and
capture; it is dated the 22d of May. Among other
things he says: "I was sent out the night before to
guard a road that the Yankees were expected to
come, but <em>fortunately for the Yankees</em>, they did not
come that way; if it had not been for that, I would
have been taken or killed myself, I expect."</p>

<p class='c000'>Our negro boy, Horace, just as we were ordered
forward to charge the hill, came up to me and said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>"Where must I go?" I replied, "Stay with the
surgeon." There were no wagons with us, with
which he usually stayed. Horace, after we were
captured, made his way home, taking with him what
little baggage I had left in his care.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus ended my experience as a Confederate
soldier in the field. I had been in active service for
three years and more.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>A PRISONER OF WAR</h3>

<p class='c008'>Now another experience was to be tried, of which
I will tell in the closing pages of these reminiscences;
long, bitter, and trying, too, that experience was.</p>

<p class='c000'>The truth shall be told, setting down nothing in
malice, giving credit where credit is due, with condemnation
and reproach when deserved.</p>

<p class='c000'>While these seventy-five men were sacrificed by
what was another "fool order," in the light of subsequent
events an advantage was gained.</p>

<p class='c000'>These companies were sent out to that hill simply
to protect the dépôt at Milford from the torch of
supposed Yankee raiders, when in truth and in
fact, Grant's whole army was approaching, and in
a few hours were upon the scene, marching by the
dépôt in which the prisoners were confined.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Grant was then on his famous flank
movement from Spottsylvania Court House, while
General Lee was moving on parallel lines in the
direction of Hanover Junction, all the while keeping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>his army between the enemy and Richmond, the goal
that the enemy had been endeavoring to reach ever
since the beginning of the war, in the spring of
1861; yet in May, 1864, the goal was far from
being attained, although hundreds of thousands of
lives had been sacrificed, and billions of dollars expended
in the effort.</p>

<p class='c000'>When it was known that the men captured at
Milford on the 21st of May were from the army
which, on the 16th of May, under Beauregard, had
soundly thrashed Beast Butler at Drury's Bluff,
and then "bottled him up at Bermuda Hundred on
James River," as General Grant expressed it, and
had come on to join forces with General Lee,
General Grant halted his army that morning, and
made dispositions to repel an attack, threw up
breastworks, and remained near Milford for two
days, giving General Lee ample time to concentrate
his forces near Hanover Junction and select a strong
position on the south bank of North Anna River.
Grant, I have since learned, mentioned these men
captured at Milford from Beauregard's army in a
dispatch to Washington, and called for more troops.
So that when General Grant finally moved forward
he was confronted by Lee with his whole army,
in a strong and commanding position, that Grant
dared not assail; instead, he again side-stepped,
flanking off towards Cold Harbor, where Lee's army
was again in his front, and where the Confederates
inflicted a loss of 12,000 men in a few hours, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>repelling assaults on their hastily formed breastworks.
This battle was fought on the ground on
which the battle of Gaines' Mill occurred on the 27th
of June, 1862, only the position of the two armies
being reversed.</p>

<p class='c000'>From Cold Harbor Grant made a long side-step,
not halting until he had crossed to the south side of
James River at City Point, where he could have
gone by water months before without the loss of a
single man. In the campaign from the Rappahannock
to the James, Grant had lost more men than
Lee had in his whole army.</p>

<p class='c000'>Grant had boasted in the early days of the
campaign in the Wilderness that he would, "fight it
out on this line if it takes all summer." But he
changed his mind as well as his line. From Cold
Harbor, it was said, Grant sent this dispatch to
Washington: "All the fight is knocked out of this
army." This was after his order to renew the
assaults on the Confederate lines had been disobeyed;
the men standing still and mute when
ordered to renew the charge. Then it was that Grant
struck out across the Peninsula to the James.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Confederate prisoners were first marched
over on the hill where the main body of Torbet's
Cavalry was posted, surrounded by a strong guard,
the Yankee officers celebrating their victory,
10,000 against 85, by feasting on wine and cake.
Lieut. Peter Akers, of Company A, marched up
to a group of these officers, sitting on their horses,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>saying: "Hello, fellows, ain't you going to treat?"
The Yanks laughed, handed around the wine and
cake to the "Rebel" officers, with whom they chatted
in a very friendly way. Like Bob Jones was with
the stolen hog, I took some of the cake, but none
of the wine.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pretty soon we were marched down to the dépôt
and confined there. It was not long until Grant's
Infantry began to march by, Hancock's corps leading,
in serried ranks of brigades, divisions, and
corps, marching on across the little Mattapony out
on the hills beyond, where lines of battle were
formed, and the digging of entrenchments begun,
and redoubts for cannon were thrown up.</p>

<p class='c000'>The prisoners were marched out later, sleeping
that night in an old barn, where they were guarded
until the army moved forward, the prisoners being
taken along. That night one of the guards said to
me, "Old man, were you drafted?" I replied, "No,
I volunteered." The reason he called me "old man"
was, my hair was gray, though I was not then
twenty-seven years old. While in prison many
thought I was a political prisoner and not a soldier,
for the same reason.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was forcibly struck with the difference in the
discipline in the two armies. In the Confederate
army the officers and privates often messed and
slept together, and were on equal terms, socially.
In the Yankee army there was a great gulf between
the officers and enlisted men, the officers rarely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>ever speaking to the men except when giving orders.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rations were short with the Yankees at this
time; the "Rebs" were, of course, very hungry,
having none at all; there were no rations at hand to
issue. Some of the Yanks, however, divided hard-tack
from their haversacks, and some fresh beef
was issued that night, which we <em>briled</em> on the coals
and ate without salt or bread. The next day the
commissary trains came up, when hard-tack was
issued; not very plentiful, however—five crackers to
the man.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the morning of the 23d the Yankee army
moved on, and that night camped on the high hills
on the north side of the North Anna River, opposite
General Lee's position.</p>

<p class='c000'>The prisoners slept in a clump of bushes not far
from General Grant's headquarters. The next
morning, as the army moved out, the prisoners still
going along, Grant and his staff rode along the
lines, when we got a good look at him.</p>

<p class='c000'>I never see a picture of Grant but that morning
is called to mind, when I recall and distinctly
remember Grant's face and figure.</p>

<p class='c000'>His appearance was not striking or prepossessing;
he reminded me of my uncle, Mack Morgan.</p>

<p class='c000'>Grant had nothing about his form, features or
bearing that compared with the handsome, noble,
and majestic appearance of Robert E. Lee.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Lee far excelled Grant in personal appearance,
as he did in generalship.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Grant's final success over Lee was not accomplished
by his genius as a general, but by the recognition
and application of the well-known laws of
physics—that a larger body put in motion will overcome
the force of a smaller one; that a greater
mass of material thrown upon a smaller mass of the
same material will crush it. To use a homely expression,
Grant overcame Lee by "main strength
and awkwardness."</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not the flashing blade of a strategist and
tactician that cut its way to victory, but the heavy
hammer of a Thor that crushed Lee and his valiant
band.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suppose Lee had had an army of anything like
equal strength in numbers, equipments and supplies,
to Grant's, is there any one who would contend that
Lee would not have prevailed over Grant? Why,
Lee would not have left a "grease spot" of Grant
and his "grand army" in the Wilderness, and there
would have been no Appomattox.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the afternoon of the 23d, there was some
fighting at the front on the North Anna River.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the Yankees crossed over above where
Lee had taken his position. Here other Confederate
prisoners were captured and added to our
squad; among them, I remember Colonel Brown,
of South Carolina, who was in the command of a
brigade of A. P. Hill's Corps. Colonel Brown said,
in advancing in line of battle, two of his regiments
got separated in the thick woods, and he walked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>through the gap in the line, right into the Yankees.
On the afternoon of the 24th of May, or the next
morning, I am not certain which, the prisoners
were turned back and headed for Port Royal, on the
Rappahannock River, under a strong cavalry guard,
a part of the way riding in wagons going back for
supplies, but marched a greater part of the distance.
As we marched, to the rear could be heard the
thunder of Lee's guns on the North Anna, bidding
defiance to Grant, saying, if not in words, in effect,
"Thus far shall thou come and no farther." On
the march to the rear, we passed large numbers of
fresh troops going to reënforce Grant, many of
them negroes. These were the first negro troops
we had ever seen. One of them remarked as we
passed by, "They ought to have gin 'em (us) Fort
Pillow. If we had cotch 'em we would have gin
'em Fort Pillow."</p>

<p class='c000'>On the last day's march I was taken very sick,
getting dizzy, and came near fainting, and dropped
down by the roadside. My brother Bob, was also
taken sick about the same time and stopped with
me. When the rearguard came up to where we
were, they commenced to shout at us, "Get up, go
on, go on." I told them we were sick and unable
to go. We did not know what would be done, but
we received humane treatment. The officer commanding
the rearguard put us in charge of a big
Dutch corporal and another man, with instructions
to bring us on when able to march.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>After a short time we were able to go on to a
house close by, on the roadside, where we rested in
the yard under the shade of the locust trees, when
the good woman of the house gave us ice-water and
something to eat, peach preserves and cold biscuits,
as I remember, which greatly refreshed and
strengthened us. God bless the Confederate women,
who were always kind to the soldiers, who suffered
so much anxiety, and endured so many privations
during the war, who, with their daughters of to-day,
are still true to the memory of the dead and the
honor and welfare of the living.</p>

<p class='c000'>We remained here perhaps half an hour, when
the guards let us ride their horses, walking at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>horses' heads, holding the bridles by the bits. This
was very kind and duly appreciated. After going
a mile or so, the Dutch corporal, with the perspiration
streaming from his face (it was a very hot,
sultry morning), stopped and said, "I ish proke down
and can't valk no farder." I told him all right, we
could make it then, and thanking him for his kindness,
we marched on, the guard telling us to take our
time.</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time we were feeling much better and
stronger, and that night, May 26th, after dark, came
up with the other prisoners at Port Royal. I am
able to fix this date from an old letter I found
some time ago, written to my wife from that place,
in which I gave the names of all the men of Company
C who were captured with me, and requested
her to have the names published in the Lynchburg
papers, that their friends might know their fate.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>ON TO WASHINGTON</h3>

<p class='c008'>The next day the prisoners were put aboard an
old freight ship, which steamed down the Rappahannock
River, out into the bay, and up the Potomac
River to Washington City. Here the officers and
men were separated. My brother Bob was very
anxious to go with me, but, of course, this was not
permissible; and there on the wharf, on the 28th
of May, 1864, I parted with him and the other
members of Company C, not to meet any of them
again until that "cruel war was over," and many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>of them never again. Some of the company not
captured were killed during the last year of the
war, and many have died since the war. Some still
live. Every now and then I read in the papers of
the death of some of them, which always recalls
memories of long ago. It will not be many years
before the last one of us shall have answered the
final roll call. May we all meet again in a better
world, where there is no war, is my fervent prayer.
War is horrible. General Sherman said, "War is
hell." Few, if any, did more than William
Tecumseh Sherman to make war hell, and if I had
to guess, I should say that ere now Sherman knows
all about the horrors of both—war and hell. There
may be something in a name after all. "Tecumseh!"
The savage.</p>

<p class='c000'>The enlisted men were sent to Point Lookout,
and the officers incarcerated in the old Capitol
Prison.</p>

<p class='c000'>I remember as we entered from the street, when
the door closed, the key turned and the bolt went
into its place with a grating sound, Captain Horton
turned to me and said, "This is the first time the
bolts were ever turned on me." So we all could
say. There were other prisoners confined here.</p>

<p class='c000'>While here, we could often see from the windows
ambulances moving along the streets filled with
wounded Yankee soldiers. When Peter Akers
would see these loads of wounded Yanks, he would
remark, "There goes more dispatches from General
Lee to old Abe."</p>

  <h2 id='CHAPTER_XVII' class='c004'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <br /> <span class='sc'>To Fort Delaware—Short Rations—Song—Prison<br /> Rules</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>These officers remained here for about two
weeks, when we were taken by boat down the
Potomac and Chesapeake Bay, passing out into the
ocean between Cape Charles and Cape Henry; thence
up the coast into Delaware Bay to Fort Delaware,
where we were placed in prison barracks with
several thousand other Confederate officers. While
at the Old Capitol Prison we were well treated, and
the rations were all we could wish. At Fort Delaware
it was very different. The rations were badly
cooked and scarcely sufficient in quantity to sustain
life, besides being very inferior in quality. There
were only two meals a day; breakfast at eight <span class='fss'>A. M.</span>,
and dinner at four <span class='fss'>P. M.</span></p>

<p class='c000'>We got to Fort Delaware in the afternoon. I was
not feeling very well and did not go to dinner. We
had some rations brought from Washington.
Captain Horton went, and the first thing he said
when he came back was, "Take care of that meat,
it is as scarce as hen's teeth here." In truth it was
very, very scarce.</p>

<p class='c000'>My brother, J. L. Morgan, who was living in
Brooklyn, N. Y., very kindly furnished me with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>clothes, and supplied me with money with which to
supplement the poor and scanty prison fare, saving
me from much suffering, and I have but little doubt,
saved my life; for many who had to depend alone
on what they got in prison died from lack of
sufficient and proper food and clothing. My brother
also furnished money to Robt. Morgan and W. L.
Brown, who was his brother-in-law, and to other
Confederate prisoners.</p>

<p class='c000'>For breakfast, we had a slice of light-bread, about
four ounces, and about one and one-half or two
ounces of bacon; for dinner the same bread and
about two or three ounces of loud-smelling pickled
beef—"red horse," as it was called—and a tin cup
of miserable stuff, called soup, so mean that I could
not swallow it. This was all, day in and day out,
week after week, and month after month. Men who
lived on these rations were always hungry. Even
those who had money did not fare much better, as
the prices at the sutlers' were so exorbitant that a
dollar did not go far. I shared the money sent me
with my bunk-mate, Capt. Thos. B. Horton.</p>

<p class='c000'>Prison life was hard and very monotonous,
though many things were resorted to to while away
the tedious hours.</p>

<p class='c000'>All kinds of games were played, "keno" being the
most popular, and much gambling went on. Concerts
were given, debating societies formed, and
many other things resorted to to kill time. My
brother sent me a set of chess-men. There were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>other sets in the prison, and this game was played
a good deal. There were some fine players among
the officers; Capt. J. W. Fanning, of Alabama,
and Capt. H. C. Hoover, of Staunton, Va., being
the champion players.</p>

<p class='c000'>I here give a song composed and sung by Confederate
prisoners at Fort Delaware, at a concert
given by the prisoners, for the benefit of the
destitute among the 600 Confederate officers, who
were put under fire on Morris Island, and afterwards
sent to Fort Pulaski and Hilton Head, and
confined there during the winter of 1864-65, and
who were sent back to Fort Delaware in March,
1865, in a pitiable plight:</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>I remained at Fort Delaware until the 20th of
August, 1864. Some time previous to this, seventy-five
field officers confined at Fort Delaware were selected
for retaliation, as the Yankees called it, to be
put under fire of the Confederate guns, on Morris
Island in Charleston Harbor.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Confederates had hospitals in one section
of the city of Charleston, S. C., with yellow flags
flying over them. The Yankees, in shelling the city
from their batteries on Morris Island, were in the
habit of shelling these hospitals, and were notified
that some of their officers, who were held as
prisoners of war, would be placed in or near the
hospitals. The Yankees did not heed this, but
prepared to put Confederate prisoners under fire of
Confederate guns, when firing on Yankee batteries
on Morris Island.</p>

<p class='c000'>Firing on hospitals, which were designated by
yellow flags, was begun by the Yankees on the 18th
of July, 1861, at Blackburn's Ford, and kept up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>during the war, contrary to the usage of all civilized
nations the world over.</p>

<p class='c000'>These seventy-five field officers were taken to
Charleston Harbor, but were not put under fire; instead,
they were exchanged for a like number of
Yankee officers.</p>

<p class='c000'>When orders came to Fort Delaware, soon after
this exchange, for 600 field and company officers to
be put under fire, there was a general desire among
the prisoners to be one of the 600, but we had no
say-so as to who should go. On the 19th of August,
all the prisoners were called out and formed in line,
when 600 names were called, and those on the list
were notified to be ready to embark the next morning
for the trip. Some were so anxious to go that
they paid others, whose names had been called, for
the privilege of surreptitiously answering to their
names. One officer gave a fine gold watch, and
after remaining away seven months, and suffering
untold privations, was landed back at Fort Delaware.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>ON SHIPBOARD</h3>

<p class='c008'>At the appointed hour on the 20th of August,
1864, the 600 officers embarked on board the
steamer <em>Crescent</em>, which steamed away down the
bay, out into the broad Atlantic, and down the coast
to Charleston Harbor, where they were landed on
the 7th day of September, having been eighteen
days aboard ship. Capt. Thos. B. Horton and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>myself were among the number, also Lieut. Peter
B. Akers, of Lynchburg.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a nasty trip on board this old freight ship,
in the summer-time. The prisoners were on the
lower or freight deck, nearly on the water line.
Two rows of temporary bunks had been built
around the sides of the ship, two tiers high. These
bunks were about six feet long and three feet wide,
with two men in each bunk; a pretty close fit,
especially if both occupants were good-sized men.
The bunks did not afford sufficient room for all the
prisoners, consequently a good many lay on the
floor of the deck between the bunks. Here the
prisoners laid and sweltered through eighteen days,
the boilers running up through the middle, making it
much hotter. I occupied a lower bunk on the inside
row with Captain Horton, who was my messmate
while a prisoner; a good fellow he was, too, and a
good soldier. There was a guard of 150 soldiers
on board, who occupied the upper deck. The
<em>Crescent</em> was escorted by a gunboat.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>RUN AGROUND</h3>

<p class='c008'>Off the coast of South Carolina, before reaching
Charleston, one night the pilot, who was a Southern
sympathizer, attempted to run the ship under the
guns of a Confederate battery on the coast, changing
the course of the ship, and heading it for land,
but unfortunately ran aground near some low-lying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>islands near the coast, not far from, but not in sight
of the mainland. When it was known at dawn of
day that the ship was aground, all hands were
aroused. Some of the prisoners who knew the
coast, said the pilot had missed the channel by only
a narrow margin, which led to the Confederate
batteries not far away, but not in sight. Nor was
the Yankee gunboat in sight; the pilot had given the
escort the slip in the darkness. It was plain to see
that the guards were very much excited and scared,
for they assembled on the top or hurricane-deck with
their guns in their hands. The crew of the
<em>Crescent</em> went to work to get the ship off the
sand-bar on which it was grounded. The prisoners
came on deck at will, the guards abandoning their
post at the hatchway, where they had been stationed
to keep all the prisoners below, except a certain
number, who were allowed to come on deck at intervals.
All hands were very anxious. Some of the
prisoners consulted and determined to make an
effort to capture the ship and guard. Col. Van
Manning, of Arkansas, was the leading spirit in the
movement. I had just come on deck and was standing
right by the colonel while he wrote a note to the
Yankee officer who commanded the guard. I think
I can give the note verbatim: "Sir—We hereby
demand the surrender of your guard and this ship.
If you comply, you and your men shall be treated as
prisoners of war; if you refuse, you will have to
take the consequences." The plan was to make a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>rush on the guard and overpower them by making
the attack with such things as were at hand about
the deck, if they refused to surrender. Just as
Colonel Manning finished writing this note, some
one looked out to sea and there was the old gunboat
bearing down upon us, and all hope of the capture
of the ship and guard was dashed to the ground.
And how quick the demeanor of the guard changed;
before the gunboat appeared they were very much
frightened, and as before said, were gathered together
on the upper deck, taking no control of the
prisoners, who came on the deck at will, but now
they were insolent and dictatorial, ordering the
prisoners to assist the crew, and taking control
again. The crew pretty soon worked the ship off the
bar and we sailed on down the coast, accompanied
by the gunboat. I have often thought what a good
joke it would have been on the Yankees if we could
have captured the ship and guard and taken them
all into port on the coast.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pilot was at once arrested and put in irons.
We learned afterwards he was court-martialed and
given a term at hard labor.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>SHORT OF WATER</h3>

<p class='c008'>While on the <em>Crescent</em> the supply of water ran
short; then the only water the prisoners had was
sea water condensed in the ships, and issued
out scalding hot in limited quantities. We would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>pour the hot water from one tin cup to another until
cool enough to swallow without burning the throat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Think of it! Nothing but hot water to drink in
the month of August on shipboard on the southern
coast. The Yankees had ice on board, but the
prisoners got none of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <em>Crescent</em> steamed on down the coast, passing
Charleston Harbor—preparations to receive the
prisoners not being completed—to Port Royal
Sound, where we remained a few days on shipboard.
Here two or three prisoners escaped from the ship
in the night-time, by dropping in the water and
swimming ashore. Only one, however, made good
his escape.</p>

<p class='c000'>While here we could see sharks swimming about
the ship. It took pretty good nerve to get in the
water and swim for the shore.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>IN THE STOCKADE</h3>

<p class='c008'>When the stockade was ready, we went up to
Charleston Harbor, landing on Morris Island, as before
said, on the 7th of September, and marched
between two lines of negro soldiers (big black, slick
negro fellows they were) two miles up the island,
and into a stockade made of pine logs set on end in
the ground, about twenty feet high, enclosing an
acre of ground. In the stockade were small fly-tents
arranged in regular military order. Four men
occupied each tent.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>The negro soldiers guarded us—the sentries, on
platforms on the outside of the stockade, about three
feet from the top. These sentries would fire upon
the slightest provocation, though I must say that
the negro soldiers treated the prisoners better than
the white officers who commanded them. For these
officers the prisoners had a perfect contempt. They
were a low-down, measly set. One Lieut.-Col.
William Gurney was in command, and the most
despisable in the lot was he.</p>

<p class='c000'>While here the rations were scant and sorry.
For breakfast, we had three crackers, sometimes
two, and sometimes only one and a half, and a very
small piece of bacon, about two ounces; towards
the last, five crackers per day were issued. For
dinner, we had soup made of some kind of dried
peas, about one pint, very unpalatable—for supper,
a pint of very thin mush or rice. The mush was
made of stale cornmeal, full of worms. One
prisoner picked out and counted 125 small, black-headed
worms from a cup of this mush. I would
pick out worms a while, and then eat the stuff a
while, then pick out more worms until all were gone.
Some just devoured worms and all, saying they
could not afford to loose that much of their rations;
that if the worms could stand it, they could. The
detestable Yankee lieutenant-colonel would sometimes
come into the camp while we were devouring
the mush and worms and with a contemptible sneer
and Yankee nasal twang, say: "You fellows need
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>fresh meat to keep off scurvy, so I give it to you in
your mush."</p>

<p class='c000'>One day all the prisoners were taken out of the
stockade, marched down to the wharf and put
aboard two old hulks or lighters and towed out in
the bay, where the hulks remained all night. The
next morning we were again landed and marched
back to the stockade. I never knew why this was
done, unless it was to search the tents for contraband
articles, or to see if there was any tunneling
going on from the tents, in order to effect escapes.
I think some efforts were made at tunneling out, but
without success.</p>

<p class='c000'>While here we were not allowed to purchase anything
to eat from the sutler unless directed by the
surgeon when sick, consequently, every man was
hungry all the while, as a whole day's rations were
not sufficient for one meal. During the time a flag-of-truce
boat passed between the island and
Charleston, by which the good women of Charleston
sent the prisoners a good supply of pipes and
tobacco, and something good to eat, which was
highly appreciated.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>UNDER FIRE</h3>

<p class='c008'>After the prisoners were placed here near the
Yankee batteries, so as to be exposed to the fire
of the Confederate guns, the Confederate batteries
did not fire a great deal. What shelling was done
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>was mostly at night. Some of the shells burst over
the stockade and the pieces would fall around, but
I don't remember that any of the prisoners were hit.
It was rather uncomfortable, though, to lie there and
watch the big shells sailing through the air, which
we could see at night by the fuse burning, and
sometimes burst above us, instead of bursting in or
above the Yankee forts 100 yards further on, and
then listen at the fragments humming through the
air and hear them strike the ground with a dull thud
among the tents. We would first hear a distant
boom, two miles away towards Charleston, and then
begin to look and listen for the shell which was sure
to follow that boom. Peter Akers used to say, "That
is trusting too much to the fuse to shoot two miles
and expect the shell to burst 100 hundred yards beyond
the stockade."</p>

<p class='c000'>The prisoners were located about midway between
two Yankee forts, Gregg and Wagner. Through the
interstices between the pine logs forming the stockade,
we could see indistinctly Fort Sumter, which
looked like a pile of ruins. The outer walls of brick
had been battered to pieces by the Yankee batteries
on Morris Island and the breaks filled up with sand
bags. The city of Charleston was also visible,
though indistinctly. We were not permitted to go
near the stockade.</p>

<p class='c000'>One day a Yankee monitor, which, with other
blockading ships, lay near the entrance of the harbor
or bay, moved up about opposite the stockade, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>engaged in a fight with the Confederate batteries.
We could see the Confederate shots strike the water
and skip along towards the Monitor, which pretty
soon got enough of it, and moved out of range.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>PRISON RULES</h3>

<p class='c008'>I also preserved a copy of the Prison Rules here,
which is as follows:</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>"The following Rules and Regulations are hereby
announced for the government of the camp of the
prisoners of war:</p>

<p class='c000'>"The prisoners will be divided into eight detachments,
seventy-five in each, lettered A, B, C, etc.,
each prisoner numbered 1, 2, 3, etc. Each detachment
will be under the charge of a warden, who
will be detailed from the guard for that duty.
There will be three roll calls each day, the first at
one-half hour before sunrise, at which time the
prisoners will be counted by the wardens, and the
reports will be taken by the officer of the day at
the company streets before the ranks are broken.
Each warden will see that the quarters in his detachment
are properly policed, and will make the detail
necessary for that duty. Sick-call will be at 9
o'clock <span class='fss'>A. M.</span> each day. Each warden will make a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>morning report to the officer in charge on blanks
suitable for that purpose. There will be two barrel
sinks for each detachment, which will be placed on
the flanks of the companies during the day and in
the company streets at night. They will be emptied
after each roll call by a detail from each detachment.
No talking will be allowed after evening roll call,
and no prisoner will leave his tent after that time
except to obey the calls of nature. During the day
the prisoners will be allowed the limits of the camp
as marked by the rope running between the stockade
and the line of tents. Prisoners passing this line
under any pretense whatever will be shot by the
sentinels. No persons except the guard and officers
on duty at the camp will be allowed to communicate
with the prisoners without written permission
from these or superior headquarters. The
sentinels will always have their guns loaded and
capped. If more than ten prisoners are seen together,
except at meal-time and roll call, they will
be warned to disperse, and if they do not obey at
once, they will be fired upon by the sentries.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If there is any disturbance whatever in the camp
or any attempt made by the prisoners to escape, the
camp will be opened upon with grape and canister,
musketry, and the Requa Batteries.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If a prisoner is sick, he may be allowed to purchase
such luxuries as the surgeon in charge may
direct. The prisoners will be allowed to purchase
only the following named articles: Writing materials,
pipes, tobacco, and necessary clothing.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>"Everything bought by or sent to them will be
inspected by the provost marshal. The prisoners
will be allowed to write letters, one a week, not more
than one-half sheet of paper to each letter. The
letters will be opened and pass through the hands
of the provost marshal before being mailed. No
candles or light of any kind will be allowed. The
hours for meals are as follows: Breakfast, 7 <span class='fss'>A. M.</span>;
dinner, 12 <span class='fss'>M.</span>; supper, 5 <span class='fss'>P. M.</span> The rations will be
cooked and served under the direction of the provost

  <h2 id='CHAPTER_XIX' class='c004'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <br /> <span class='sc'>To Fort Pulaski—Rotten Cornmeal and<br /> Pickled Rations—A Plot Laid</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>On the 17th of October the prisoners were
notified to be ready to move at daylight next morning.
In one of the tents the next morning, in order
to see how to get ready, one of the prisoners struck
a light, when the negro guard fired into the tent,
wounding two of the occupants badly, one through
the knee and the other in the shoulder. On the
18th we were marched to the wharf and put aboard
two old hulks and towed out to sea. We had been
forty-two days in this stockade and were glad
enough to get away. But alas! we did not know
what was in store for us later on. Three days'
rations, so-called, had been issued—fifteen crackers
and about five or six ounces of bacon. After being
at sea three days and two nights, one hulk-load of
300 were landed at Fort Pulaski, on Tybee Island,
Ga., at the mouth of the Savannah River, and the
other 300 were landed at Hilton Head, a short distance
up the coast.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fort Pulaski was built of brick, with very thick
walls, surrounded by a wide moat, was very damp,
and when the east winds blew, very cold and disagreeable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>there being no window-lights in the embrasures
to the casements in which the prisoners were
confined—only iron bars. Here the prisoners were
guarded by the 127th N. Y. Regiment, commanded
by Col. W. W. Brown, who treated the prisoners
kindly.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this regiment there were a great many youths
in their teens. I remarked on this in a conversation
with a Yankee sergeant, who stated that these
boys were put into the army by their fathers for the
sake of the large bounties paid, which, in many cases,
amounted to $2,000 and over, and that these
fathers were using the money to buy homes and
lands for themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just like a Yankee—he would sell his own flesh
and blood for money!</p>

<p class='c000'>The Confederate soldiers were patriots, fighting
for their country, while a large majority of the
Yankee army were hirelings, fighting for money.
Yet these hirelings are lauded as patriots by the
North and pensioned by the United States Government!</p>

<p class='c000'>For a time the rations were better here than on
Morris Island. All the men and officers of this
regiment had seen service in the field and had a
fellow-feeling for a soldier, although he was a
"Rebel" prisoner. Whenever we were guarded by
Yankees who had never seen service in the field,
they were as mean as snakes. The guards at Fort
Delaware were of the latter kind—they shot several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>prisoners without cause. One instance I remember
was that of Colonel —— Jones, of Virginia, who
was sick and very feeble, scarcely able to walk. He
had gone to the sink and had started back when a
guard ordered him to move faster, which he could
not do, and was shot through the body, dying the
next day. The miscreant boasted that, "This makes
two Rebels my gun has killed."</p>

<h3 class='c007'>ROTTEN CORNMEAL AND PICKLED RATIONS</h3>

<p class='c008'>While at Fort Pulaski, Gen. J. G. Foster, the
Yankee general commanding the department, and a
cruel, unfeeling wretch he must have been, issued
an order to put the prisoners on ten ounces of cornmeal
and half pint of onion pickles per day.</p>

<p class='c000'>This cornmeal was shipped from the North, was
completely spoiled and utterly unfit for food, being
mouldy, in hard lumps, and full of worms, big and
little, some of them an inch long. The brands on
the barrels showed that this cornmeal was ground
at Brandywine in the year 1861. This was done, it
was said, in retaliation for the Confederates feeding
the Yankee prisoners on cornbread and sour
sorghum. We would have been very glad to have
gotten cornbread and sorghum, such as the Yankee
prisoners had. They did not even give us salt,
absolutely nothing but this ten ounces of rotten,
wormy cornmeal and pickles, and would not allow
those who had money to buy anything to eat from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>the sutler's. Some say that Edward M. Stanton,
the Yankee Secretary of War, the arch-fiend of
South-haters, was responsible for this cruel treatment.
It savored of many of Stanton's acts during
and after the war. In consequence of this inhuman
order, there was a great deal of sickness and many
deaths among the prisoners. "Starved to death,"
said the Yankee surgeon who attended the sick,
"medicine will do them no good." Scurvy, a loathsome
disease, prevailed to an alarming extent; the
gums would become black and putrid, the legs full
of sores, drawn and distorted. Many a poor fellow,
in attempting to make his way to the sinks, would
fall fainting to the ground. I remember, in one
day, assisting three of these unfortunates to rise
from the ground and back to their bunks. To
substantiate what I have here recorded as facts, I
give the following from the "War of the Rebellion,
Official Records of the Union and Confederate
Armies, Series II, Vol. VIII, page 163":</p>

to receive necessary articles of clothing from their

</div>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>Now, here it is from their own records, showing
how wantonly and cruelly the Yankees treated these
prisoners.</p>

<p class='c000'>During these frightful days I made a ring out of
a gutta-percha button, which was traded to a Yankee
soldier, on the sly, for a good chunk of middling
meat, which was a Godsend. I escaped the scurvy,
but my messmate, Captain Horton, had it pretty
badly, although I shared the meat with him. The
prisoners killed and ate all the cats they could catch.
I ate a small piece of a cat myself, and would have
eaten more if I could have gotten it. One of the
Yankee officers had a fat little dog that followed
him into the casemates when making his tours of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>inspection; the hungry prisoners longed to get this
dog, but he kept close to his master's heels, as if
cognizant of the fact that he was on dangerous
ground. With half a chance he would have been
caught, killed, skinned, and devoured in short order.
Some one may have nabbed this dog; I don't know.</p>

<p class='c000'>These starvation days lasted about two months.
During this time a Yankee major, out of compassion
for the starving prisoners, went out with a boat and
net one day, caught and gave to the prisoners a
number of fresh fish, which were greatly enjoyed.
This kindness was duly appreciated. But those
higher in authority forbade its repetition, and we
got no more fish.</p>

<p class='c000'>While at Fort Pulaski the "Lee Chess Club" got
out a paper, in pen and ink, foolscap size; I was one
of the scribes and preserved a copy. A few years
ago I sent this copy to the Confederate Museum at
Richmond, Va., where it is now preserved in a glass
case in the Virginia Room, in the White House of
the Confederacy.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>A PLOT LAID</h3>

<p class='c008'>While here, six officers laid a plan to capture the
ship when we were removed from the place, it being
often rumored we were to be taken away. These
six officers each selected ten others to act with them.
No one else knew anything of the plot. I do not
remember the names of the leaders. Captain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>Horton and myself were among the number selected.</p>

<p class='c000'>About the 1st of March, rumors were rife that
we were to be moved, and the plot was perfected as
far as possible. The plan was to overpower the
guard when at sea, take charge of the ship and run
it to Nassau, or some other neutral port, in the
West Indies. While here, some of the prisoners
escaped from the hospital. Only one, however,
made good and got safely away. Those recaptured
were put in irons, cast into a foul dungeon, and
cruelly treated.</p>

  <h2 id='CHAPTER_XX' class='c004'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <br /> <span class='sc'>Back to Fort Delaware—Disappointment and<br /> Great Suffering—Three Deaths and<br /> Burials at Sea</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>About the 3d or 4th of March, I think it was, the
soldiers guarding us said an order had been received
from General Grant, "an autograph letter," they
said, to take us to Norfolk; thence up James River
to City Point, for exchange. This was joyful news,
indeed, and with eagerness and high hopes the
prisoners made preparations to leave that dismal
place. The next day we boarded a small steamer
and were off for Dixie, as all believed. We left
many a poor comrade buried in the sand on that
Tybee Island, victims of Yankee cruelty and hatred.</p>

<p class='c000'>After taking on board the prisoners at Hilton
Head, the ship was so heavily loaded that the
captain refused to put to sea. All the prisoners
were then transferred to the steamship <em>Illinois</em>, a
larger and better boat, which sailed for Norfolk.
So certain were all that an exchange would be
effected, no effort was made to carry out the plan
to capture the ship. The guards on the ship paid
little or no attention to the prisoners; they virtually
had the freedom of the ship, could go on deck at
will, and could have taken possession without the
loss of a single man. There was no gunboat escort.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>On this trip up the coast there was a great deal
of seasickness. There was no storm, but the ship
rolled considerably. I was sick myself, and as I
lay in a bunk down on the lower deck, looking out
a small porthole at the huge billows, feeling very
miserable, I made up my mind if anything happened
to the ship, to just lay still and go down with it without
making any effort to save myself. I remember
one poor fellow who was suffering terribly, groaning
and heaving as if trying to throw up his very
"gizzard," when some one called out, "Give that
man a piece of fat meat, it will help him." The sick
man cried out in his agony, "O Lord God, don't
talk about fat meat to me." Any one who has been
sea-sick knows what an aversion the nausea produces
to food, especially fat meat.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the night of the 7th of March we dropped
anchor at Norfolk, thinking of nothing but that the
next morning we would steam up the historic James
to City Point, and there be exchanged.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>DISAPPOINTMENT AND GREAT SUFFERING</h3>

<p class='c008'>The next morning the ship weighed anchor, with
many of us on deck in high spirits. Soon after
getting under way, the ship was hailed by a gunboat,
lying in Hampton Roads, with "Where are you
bound?" The captain of the <em>Illinois</em> shouted back
through his trumpet, "Fort Delaware." Oh, horror
of horrors! our hearts sank within us; visions of
exchange, of home and friends, vanished in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>twinkling. Doomed to further incarceration in a
detestable Yankee prison, when we had expected in a
few short hours to be free and with friends! With
hope, aye, certainly of relief, dashed to the ground,
our feelings may be better imagined than expressed
in words. The doom of the damned, "Depart from
me ye cursed into everlasting fire," can not be much
worse. The Yankee guards on board the ship were
at once on the alert, and with harsh and insolent commands,
ordered and compelled, at point of bayonet,
all the prisoners to get off the deck, and would not
allow, after this, more than six or eight men on deck
at a time; sentinels with loaded guns and fixed
bayonets stood at the hatchways above us, and there
was no chance to take the ship. One scoundrel
threatened to shoot me as I stood at the foot of
the ladder, with my hand on it, awaiting my turn
to go on deck. He said to me in an insolent tone,
"Take your hand off that ladder." I did so, then
he said, "If you are an officer, why don't you dress
like an officer?" I replied, "It is none of your business
how I dress." Then he said, "Damn you, I will
shoot you," bringing down his cocked gun on me,
when I stepped back out of sight, thinking "discretion
the better part of valor." How much the
seventy men in the plot regretted not putting that
plot into execution can never be told.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THREE DEATHS AND BURIALS AT SEA</h3>

<p class='c008'>While on the way up the coast to Fort Delaware,
the suffering among the prisoners was greatly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>intensified. The sick and disabled especially were
downcast, and in utter despair; a more miserable
set of men were perhaps never seen on board a ship.
The floor of the lower deck was covered with
vomit, which sloshed from side to side as the ship
rolled back and forth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gloom and despair sat like a black pall on every
face. Before Fort Delaware was reached, three
officers died and were buried at sea. I witnessed
one of the burials. The body was sewed up in a
blanket with a cannon ball at the feet, then placed
on a plank, feet foremost, which was pushed out
over the side of the ship and the plank tilted up,
when all that was mortal of the poor fellow slid
off, and dropped into the sea, many feet below, to
rest in a watery grave until the final roll call at
the Judgment Day, "when the sea shall give up its
dead."</p>

<p class='c000'>Seventy-five sick were taken from the ship to the
hospital, and many more were hardly able to walk,
but the hospital was full. We disembarked at Fort
Delaware on the 12th of March, 1865.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was said the reason we were not exchanged,
was that upon the arrival of the prisoners at
Hampton Roads their condition was so horrible the
Yankees did not want the Confederate authorities
and the world to know their condition, hence they
were shipped back to Fort Delaware.</p>

<p class='c000'>That the exchange was ordered by General Grant
I here present proof from the same volume of "War
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>Records," before quoted from, on page 417, where

world exaggerated accounts of the conditions of
their soldiers in Confederate prisons, and are still
at it, all the while refusing to exchange prisoners,
except in a few instances.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Yankees during the war did many mean,
contemptible and uncivilized things, but I have
always thought about the most contemptible and
meanest thing they did was when, sometimes, there
was an exchange of sick and wounded prisoners,
they would strip to the skin their sick and wounded
men, the most emaciated, have their pictures taken
and sent broadcast over the country, to fire the
Northern people and prejudice the world against the
Confederates, when they knew the Confederate sick
from Northern prisons were equally emaciated; but
never a picture of these did they take and scatter
abroad. I have seen some of these pictures. They
are still harping on the horrors of Andersonville,
but never a word do they utter about the wilful,
malicious and cruel treatment of prisoners on Morris
Island, and in Fort Pulaski, and Hilton Head.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>The Confederates fed the Yankee prisoners, as
best they could, the same rations issued to Confederate
soldiers—cut off as they were from the world,
a large part of their country overrun by a brutal
and merciless foe, who carried desolation and
destruction through the land, wherever their worse
than Hessian hoards went. There was much suffering
everywhere in the South.</p>

<p class='c000'>Food was scarce in the South, women and
children suffered, and our own soldiers in the field
had scanty rations, very often nothing but bread
and not enough of that, while the Yankees, with
plenty of supplies, their ports open to the world,
less than half fed the Confederates in all their
prisons, through malice and revenge.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a well-known fact, established by the records,
that while there were more Yankee prisoners in
Southern prisons than there were Confederates in
Northern prisons, many thousands more of Confederate
prisoners died in Northern prisons than
Yankees in Southern prisons. It is established by
the records of the war office at Washington that,
during the war, Yankee prisoners to the number of
270,000 were captured and that 220,000 Confederates
were captured. Of these prisoners 20,000
Yankees died in Southern prisons (about eight per
cent.), while 26,000 Confederate prisoners died in
Northern prisons (about sixteen per cent. of those
captured). Most of the Confederate prisoners were
confined in prisons in cold lake regions, and at Point
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>Lookout, where they suffered untold miseries from
exposure in those bleak locations. Confined in open,
board barracks and tents with a very, very scant
supply of fuel, with only a few thin blankets, thin,
worn out clothing, and less than half fed, no
wonder many of them died, victims of Yankee
cruelty.</p>

<p class='c000'>Let it ever be remembered that all this suffering,
privation, and tens of thousands of deaths, were
caused by the Yankees during the last two years of
the war refusing to exchange prisoners, while the
Confederates were always willing and anxious to
exchange. General Grant said, when urged to agree
to exchanges to prevent suffering and death in
prison of his own men, "It is hard on our men confined
in Southern prisons, but it would be harder on
our soldiers in the field to consent to an exchange,
because, if the 30,00 Rebel prisoners were released,
they would go back to the army and fight, while our
men would return to their homes." The Confederate
authorities offered the Yankees the privilege of
sending food, medicine, and hospital supplies to
their prisoners in the South to be dispensed by
Yankee doctors, but the offer was coldly and cruelly
declined.</p>

<p class='c000'>As proof of this, I refer to Col. Robt. Olds' letter
to General Grant, dated Richmond, Va., January
24, 1865, in "War of the Rebellion, Official Records
of the Union and Confederate Armies," Series II,
Vol. 2, pages 122-23, published by the United States
Government.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>Not only this, but in truth no reply was made.
They made medicine contraband of war; that is,
they would not allow medicine to be shipped into the
South any more than they would powder and lead
or food or clothing—something no other nation of
modern times has ever done. These things here
recorded are historic, known and read by all men.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>CONDUCT OF THE WAR</h3>

<p class='c008'>The conduct of the war on the part of the North
was cold-blooded and cruel in the highest degree.
The Northern soldiers burned and pillaged thousands
of homes, and ruthlessly destroyed millions
of dollars' worth of private property. The beautiful
and fertile Valley of Virginia, "the garden spot of
the world," was made a howling wilderness by
wanton destruction and devastation; every mill and
barn was burned, together with many dwellings;
every kind of food for man or beast was destroyed,
and the women and children left in a pitiable plight,
the vandal Sheridan sending a message to Grant
after the dastardly work was done, that "A crow
flying over the Valley would have to take his rations
with him." Gen. U. S. Grant had ordered this
destruction and devastation, and found in Sheridan
a willing tool to execute the infamous order.</p>

<p class='c000'>The annals of history, ancient or modern, furnish
few if any atrocities equal to those perpetrated
by the Northern armies. The monster, Sherman,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>in his march through Georgia and North Carolina,
burned and pillaged as no army ever did before,
leaving a burned and blackened swath behind him
forty to sixty miles wide. A few years ago, when
the world was horrified at the cruelty the United
States soldiers practiced on the Philippinos, including
the "water cure," which consisted of inserting a
rubber tube into the throat while the victim lay
bound on his back, and pouring water in the tube
and down the throat until the stomach was filled
and distended to its fullest capacity, then jumping
on the victim's stomach with the feet, forcing the
water out, repeating the operation time and time
again—when I read of this I remarked to some
one that I was not surprised: that the Yankees
were mean enough to do anything; that I knew
them of old.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>SHERMAN'S MARCH</h3>

<p class='c008'>General Sherman, in his official report of his
operations in Georgia, says: "We consumed the corn
and fodder in the country thirty miles on either side
of a line from Atlanta to Savannah: also the sweet
potatoes, hogs, sheep, poultry, and carried off more
than 10,000 horses and mules. I estimate the
damage done to the State of Georgia at one hundred
million dollars, at least, twenty millions of which
inured to our benefit, and the remainder was simply
waste and destruction." Could anything be more
diabolical?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>From Gen. Bradley Johnston's "Life of Gen.
Jos. E. Johnston," I take the following extracts,
descriptive of Sherman's march: "A solid wall of
smoke by day forty miles wide, and from the
horizon to the zenith, gave notice to the women and
children of the fate that was moving on them. At
early dawn the black veil showed the march of the
burners. All day they watched it coming from the
northwest, like a storm-cloud of destruction. All
night it was lit up by forked tongues of flame, lighting
the lurid darkness. The next morning it reached
them. Terror borne on the air, fleet as the furies,
spread out ahead, and murder, arson, rapine,
enveloped them. Who can describe the agonies of
mothers for their daughters, for their babes, for
their fathers and young boys?</p>

<p class='c000'>"This crime was organized and regulated with
intelligence and method. Every morning details
were sent out in advance and on the flanks. The
burners spread themselves over the whole country
for miles beyond either flank of the marching
columns, and they robbed everything.</p>

<p class='c000'>"All valuables, gold, silver, jewels, watches, etc.,
were brought in at night and a fair division made
of them among all parties. The captain was entitled
to so much, the colonel to his share, the general to
his portion.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Let a few other things also speak. Major-General
Halleck, then, I believe, commander-in-chief,
under the President, of the armies of the Union, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>the 18th of December, 1864, dispatched as follows
to General Sherman, then in Savannah: 'Should you
capture Charleston, I hope that by some accident the
place may be destroyed, and if a little salt should
be sown upon its site, it may prevent the growth of
future crops of nullification and secession.'"</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 26th of December, 1864, General Sherman
made the following answer: "I will bear in mind
your hint as to Charleston, and don't think that 'salt
will be necessary.' When I move, the Fifteenth
Corps will be on the right wing, and the position
will bring them naturally into Charleston first, and
if you have watched the history of that corps, you
will have remarked that they generally do their
work pretty well. The truth is, the whole army is
burning with an insatiable desire to wreak vengeance
upon South Carolina."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Northern people have immortalized these
dastardly deeds in the song, "Marching Through
Georgia," and still exultingly sing and play it, which
but perpetuates an infamy which should and does
cause every American, worthy of the name, to hang
his head in shame.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here we have it from those high in authority
approving and urging on the demons in human
form who were perpetrating the most dastardly
atrocities, and gloating over it, too. Who can doubt
but that Hades burned hotter and his Satanic
Majesty rubbed his hands in glee, when Stanton,
Halleck, Sherman, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et id genus omne</span></i>, were hurled
headlong into the bottomless pit?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>How different was the conduct of General Lee
and his army when invading the enemy's country!

<h3 class='c007'>VIRGINIA DISMEMBERED</h3>

<p class='c008'>A most atrocious act of the Yankee Government
during the war, high-handed and inexcusable and
without any semblance of law, right or necessity,
was the dismemberment of the State of Virginia,
when the old Mother of States was despoiled of one-third
of her territory. West Virginia, cleft as it
was from the side of the old Mother State by the
sword, when in the throes of war, left that mother
bleeding, and robbed of her richest mineral territory.
Not that it would make the United States Government
any stronger or richer, but only to satiate the
hatred, revenge and malice of the Yankee nation.
Virginia! The proud Old Dominion, that in 1795
voluntarily gave to the young Republic that vast
northwestern domain, 250,000 square miles in
extent, which her sons, during the Revolutionary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>War, single-handed and alone, under the leadership
of the indomitable George Rogers Clark, wrested
from the British and their Indian allies, and which
now comprises the states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,
Michigan, Wisconsin, and that part of Minnesota
east of the Mississippi River; yet her original
domains, as one of the thirteen States as fixed and
adjusted after Kentucky was formed, and the ceding
to the United States of this great western empire;
the oldest, foremost, and proudest of the States, on
whose shores the first English settlement on the
continent was made, whose ter-centennial in this
year of Grace, 1907, is being celebrated, and on
whose sacred soil the fires of liberty were kindled
and fanned into flame by the burning words, "Give
me liberty or give me death," which fell from the
lips of her own Patrick Henry; yet Virginia, the
proud old Mother of States and statesmen, her
borders extending from the sands on the ocean
shore on the east to the Ohio River on the west,
must be cut in twain, in hatred, in malice and in
revenge.</p>

<p class='c000'>These facts, the treatment of prisoners, and
destruction of private property, are here recorded
that the truth of history may be vindicated,
and that the cold-blooded and cruel atrocities of
the enemies of the South may not be forgotten.
Multiplied instances of cruelty and vandalism might
be here written down, but the subject is distasteful.</p>

<p class='c000'>All this cruelty and these wanton acts of devastation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>and destruction were visited on the South and
her people, not because they were criminals and outlaws,
but to satiate Yankee hatred and revenge.
That the South acted within her rights in withdrawing
from the Union is now conceded by all
unbiased and fair-minded men who have intelligence
enough to investigate the rights of the states under
the original compact—the Bill of Rights, the constitutions
of several states, and the Constitution of
the United States.</p>

<p class='c000'>Impartial history will accord the South honor,
genius, skill, bravery and endurance, under adverse
conditions, unexampled; victories many, against
great odds. Truthfully has it been said of the
Confederacy:</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>While to the North will be accorded success
through unlimited resources and vastly superior
numbers, together with dishonor and shame for
cruelty, revengefulness and wanton destruction of
private property, unequaled in modern history.</p>

  <h2 id='CHAPTER_XXII' class='c004'>CHAPTER XXII<br /> <br /> <span class='sc'>Lee's Surrender—Lincoln's Assassination—Out<br /> of Prison and at Home</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Prison life at Fort Delaware had not improved
any during the absence of the 600; the same bad,
scanty rations were still served, with no surcease of
the tedious, weary hours. When General Lee
surrendered at Appomattox on the 9th of April,
1865, the prisoners were very much depressed, and
almost the last hope of the establishment of the
independence of the South vanished. A meeting
of the Virginia officers was held to consult as to
what was best to be done. Gen. Jos. E. Johnston
was still in the field with an army in North
Carolina, and Gen. Kirby Smith, commanding the
Trans-Mississippi Department, was in Texas with a
few thousand men. Whether we would abandon
all hope and get out of prison as soon as possible
by taking the oath of allegiance to the United States
Government, which was offered, or await future
events, were the questions discussed. Several
speeches were made. Among the speakers I remember
Capt. Jas. Bumgardner, of Staunton;
Capt. H. Clay Dickerson, of Bedford, and Capt.
Don P. Halsey, of Lynchburg. Captain Halsey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>closed his speech by submitting a motion: "That
the meeting take no action at present," which motion
I seconded, and it was carried unanimously. We
were not yet ready to surrender to what seemed to
be the inevitable. General Johnston was still standing
before the enemy with his tattered, battered, and
shattered battalions, and we considered our unqualified
allegiance was still due to the Confederacy
while he thus stood. The remaining days of April
were anxious and exciting ones.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>LINCOLN'S ASSASSINATION</h3>

<p class='c008'>When the news of the assassination of Lincoln,
which occurred on the night of the 14th of April,
1865, reached Fort Delaware the next morning,
there was great excitement among the Yankee
guards and prisoners also. The Yankee soldiers
looked mad and vindictive, and the guards were
doubled. Visions of retaliatory measures—banishment
to Dry Tortugas, or worse—rose up before the
Confederate officers. If retaliation was resorted
to, no one knew how many Southern lives it would
take to appease the wrath and vengeance of the
North. If lots were cast for the victims, no one
knew who would draw the black ballots. While all
were discussing these questions in all seriousness,
Peter Akers, the wit of the prison, broke the tension
with the remark, "It was hard on old Abe to
go through the war and then get bushwhacked in
a theater."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>The Yankees almost moved heaven and earth to
implicate the Confederate authorities in the assassination
of Lincoln, but failed most signally. No
doubt, they would have given worlds, if at their
command, if President Jeff Davis and other leaders
could have been connected with the plot and crime.
As is well known, Boothe, the assassin, was shot
dead in the attempt to capture him, and that a man
named Harold, who was with Boothe when killed:
Payne, who the same night attempted to assassinate
Secretary of State, Wm. H. Seward, and Mrs.
Surratt—were hung, the latter in all probability
innocent of any crime; there was no evidence to
connect her with the assassination or the plot. Some
of the assassins boarded at her house and her son
fled.</p>

<p class='c000'>The assassination of Lincoln was the act of a
scatter-brained actor, John Wilkes Boothe, and did
the South no good, if, indeed, it was so intended.
Many people think that if Lincoln had lived the
South would have fared much better after the war.
I do not think so. Lincoln might have been disposed
to have dealt more justly with the South, but in my
opinion he would have been overruled by the
Sewards, the Stantons, the Mortons, the Garrisons,
and the Thad Stevenses, and many more of that ilk,
who lived and died inveterate haters and vilifiers
of the Southern people. Meanness is bred in the
bone of some people. If Lincoln ever did a kindly
or generous act in behalf of the South, I do not
recall it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>When Gen. Joseph E. Johnston surrendered on
the 26th day of April, 1865, the last vestige of hope
against hope vanished. We felt like saying, "'Tis
the last libation that Liberty draws from the heart
that bleeds and breaks in her cause."</p>

<h3 class='c007'>OUT OF PRISON AND AT HOME</h3>

<p class='c008'>I remained at Fort Delaware until the 21st day
of May, 1865, when I was released by a special
order from Washington, which my brother had procured,
and who brought the order to Fort Delaware
and accompanied me to New York and to his home
in Brooklyn. So that I was a prisoner of war one
year to a day. I came out of prison in a much worse
condition, physically, than when captured. Three
years of active service in the field was as nothing
to my experience in prison, although I did not suffer
as much as thousands of poor fellows who received
no aid from friends. I was sick several times while
in prison, but had no serious illness, but was much
debilitated at the end.</p>

<p class='c000'>We left Fort Delaware on the steamer <em>Mentor</em>,
going up Delaware River to Philadelphia, and thence
by train and boat to New York.</p>

<p class='c000'>After remaining in New York about two weeks
recuperating, my brother and family and myself
left for Virginia and home, going by steamer to
Norfolk; thence up James River to Richmond,
where we found a large part of the city in ashes.
Gloomy and distressing was the scene. Here I met
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>General Kemper and other comrades. The next
day we took the train for Lynchburg—on the old
Richmond &amp; Danville Railroad. At Burkeville we
found the road to Farmville destroyed. My brother
and family went by private conveyance to Farmville,
while I remained at Burkeville, sitting up all
night guarding the baggage, as the railroad system
was so out of joint and deranged that no care could
be taken of baggage by the officials. The next
morning I went by wagon to Farmville with the
baggage, when we again took the train to another
break in the road at James River below Lynchburg.
Here we got aboard an old-fashioned canal boat,
drawn by an old mule or two, which landed us at
Lynchburg. The next day we went to my father's,
twenty-one miles, in Campbell County, and joined
the loved ones there. The reunion was a happy one.
But what a change! Scores of thousands of dollars'
worth of property gone forever, and the future, with
reconstruction and attempted negro domination,
staring us in the face, the prospect was anything
but encouraging. But all was not lost; honor and
truth still lived, though might had triumphed over
right.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus ended my four years of service to the Confederacy,
which I served loyally and willingly, and
my only regret is that we all could not have
rendered our dear Southland more efficient service,
even to the full fruition of our fondest hopes in the
beginning.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>I had three brothers in the army, all of us escaping
without the loss of life or limb. The youngest,
Taylor, was only in service a short time, being only
thirteen years of age when the war began. He was
in the cavalry service, as was my brother, Coon,
towards the end.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>As a fit climax to, and exhibitory of, Yankee
hatred, malice, revenge, and cruelty practiced during
the war, the North bound the prostrate South on the
rock of negro domination, while the vultures,
"carpet-baggers" and "scalawags," preyed upon its
vitals. Unlike Prometheus, however, the South did
not have its chains broken by a Hercules, but rose
in its own might and severed the fetters that bound
it, and drove away the birds of prey, and her people
are now free and independent, controlling their own
state affairs without let or hindrance; though many
at the North are still growling and snarling,
threatening reduction of representation in Congress,
howling about negro disfranchisement, and the
separation of the races in schools and public conveyances.</p>

<p class='c000'>Let it never be forgotten that in Virginia in 1868,
80,000 "carpet-baggers," "scalawags," and negroes
voted to disfranchise every Confederate soldier who
fought for home and native land, and every man in
the State, young or old, who would not swear that
he had never given aid or comfort to the soldiers
in the field, or sympathized with the Southern cause.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>Armed Yankee soldiers were posted at every courthouse
in the land. Civil law gave place to arbitrary
military rule. The names of states were obliterated,
the states being designated as "Military Districts
Nos. 1, 2, 3," etc. Detectives were abroad in the
land. Everything that Yankee ingenuity and malignancy
could conceive of was done to humiliate the
Southern people. This service was very distasteful
to some of the Yankee officers and soldiers, but they
were urged on by the venom of a majority at the
North. Peaceful citizens were hauled up before
the military courts on complaints of worthless and
vicious negroes, whose word was taken before that
of the white man.</p>

<p class='c000'>The "carpet-baggers" were unprincipled Northern
men who came South after the war—political
adventurers and freebooters—to steal and plunder
as office-holders. The "scalawags" were native white
men, many of them skulkers and deserters during
the war, who, like the "carpet-baggers," sought
political office—"apostates for the price of their
apostasy." They took sides against their kith and
kin, fawning on the Northern South-haters and traducers,
joining in with the despoilers of the South,
"that thrift might follow fawning."</p>

<p class='c000'>And all these atrocities practiced by the North
in the name of "liberty and freedom," and, as it
was often expressed, that, "treason might be made
odious." "Oh, Liberty, what crimes are enacted in
thy name!" Treason, indeed! Lee and Jackson
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>"traitors"? Blistered be the tongue that utters
it. The brave men of the South who for four years
fought as never men fought before. "Traitors"?
Palsied be the hand that writes it. The charge of
treason against the South is as black as the hearts
that conceived it, and as false as the tongues that
uttered it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Henrich Heine, in speaking of England's banishment
of Napoleon and his death on the lonely island
of St. Helena, says, "Brittania! thou art queen of
the ocean, but all great Neptune's ocean can not
wash from thee the stain that the great Emperor
bequeathed thee on his deathbed."</p>

<p class='c000'>Well might it be said of the Washington Government,
both during the war and afterwards, that not
all the waters of all the oceans can wash away the
stains of infamy practiced by it upon the South and
her people. The cruel torture of President Davis
at Fortress Monroe is a "damned spot that will not
out," along with thousands of other acts, some of
which I have enumerated.</p>

<p class='c000'>A large majority of the Northern people were
bitter enemies of the South, vilifying and slandering
the Southern people, and sought to degrade and
oppress them in many ways, but not all of them
were so disposed, and many others are beginning
to see the heinousness and folly of Reconstruction.</p>

<p class='c000'>A late Northern paper, the Brooklyn <cite>Eagle</cite>, says:
"Under Reconstruction the Republican party outlawed
character, dispensed with fairness, degraded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>decency, elevated ignorance and invested in barbarism,
under all the forms of politics which covered
the fact of brigandage." A true and just arraignment
by a Northern man, it gives a true statement
of facts in a few words.</p>

<p class='c000'>No wonder, then, the great mass of the people of
the South have stood together for their section, and
are political opponents of their traducers and
persecutors.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are, however, many just and good men at
the North who were opposed to the invasion of
the South by the Northern armies and the waging
of that cruel war, who have, since the war, battled
for the rights of the South, and held in check, to
some extent, that puritanical element which, like the
Pharisee, ascribes to itself all the virtue and intelligence
of the land.</p>

<p class='c000'>The original Puritans came to this country, as
they said, to escape persecution. I think the truth
is, they left their native country for that country's
good. I have often thought that if the <em>Mayflower</em>
had landed at the bottom of the ocean instead of on
Plymouth Rock, it would have been much better
for this country.</p>

<p class='c000'>The New England Yankees are, in a large
measure, responsible for the events that brought on
the war, and for the atrocities committed in the
South during and since the war. I don't believe
the West and South would ever have gone to war
had it not been for this puritanical spirit of New
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>England. Envy is the ruling attribute of the
Puritan; magnanimity is foreign to the Puritan
nature. One thing formerly practiced by the New
Englanders, they utterly failed to establish in this
country. A good thing it was too for the old women,
or else many more of them might have been burned,
hanged or drowned as witches, as was done in New
England when the Puritan spirit prevailed in its
undiluted state.</p>

<p class='c000'>As before said, the sentiment at the North is
changing in favor of the South; many are beginning
to learn the true history of the past and present
state of affairs, though the South still has its
traducers and slanderers there, for in this year of
grace, 1907, a Sunday-school magazine up North
printed in its columns the following: "And when
General Lee invaded Pennsylvania, at the time of
the battle of Gettysburg, destruction and rapine
followed in the wake of the invaders. There was
evil and misfortune at every turn." A bigger lie
was never told. A fouler slander was never uttered.</p>

<p class='c000'>The South, despite its enemies, is advancing
rapidly in material interests, and is destined to be
the most prosperous portion of the United States.
"King Cotton" is coming to his throne again. The
South has always been the most chivalrous, conservative
and American-like, holding more closely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>to the traditions, customs, and manners of the old
days, where the high and unselfish principles of
right, justice and honor, which go to make up the
true gentleman and patriotic citizen, have always
prevailed. The pure Anglo-Saxon blood still
predominates in the South, as well as the spirit of
the cavalier. Blood will tell.</p>

<p class='c000'>The average Yankee has a very poor conception
of what is right and honorable in his transactions
and intercourse with his fellow-man, and very faint
conceptions of those principles of right and justice
which are the same among men of honor, world
without end. To drive a sharp bargain, to get
money no matter how, but to get money, and diffuse
and enforce his own ideas and notions, seem to be
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">summa summorum</span></i> of all his ends—as witness
the developments in the past few years of rascality
and thieving being brought to light at the North, as
it exists among the "great captains of finance," as
they are wont to be called; I think "great thieves"
would be a much more suitable appellation. The
foundations of many of the great, overgrown fortunes
at the North were laid during the war by
swindling and stealing by Government contractors,
and they are still at it. Graft, graft; fraud, fraud,
everywhere and in everything they touch.</p>

<p class='c000'>As before said, the South is coming to its own
again. I firmly believe the days of retribution will
come when the evil deeds the North perpetrated in
the South during and since the war, will be avenged,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>not in kind perhaps, but in some way. "The gods
wait long, but they are just at last;" their "mills
grind slowly, but they grind exceeding fine." God
is just; His will be done.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have written much more than I anticipated in
the beginning—the subject and occurrences opened
up the "cells where memory sleeps." The more I
wrote, the more I recalled.</p>

<p class='c000'>These reminiscences were commenced several
years ago and virtually completed last February.
Since then they have been gone over, revised, added
to and some parts rewritten, and now on this, the
31st day of December, in the year of our Lord,
1907, the last day of the year, are completed.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
